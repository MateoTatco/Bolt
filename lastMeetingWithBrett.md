Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 12 segundos
Now I'll add you as well, Brett, and I'll add the user over here. So these two accounts under user management should get the invitation via notification on their Bolt app. So as soon as they get the notification, they'll be able to go to their own profiles.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 31 segundos
On the app, I'll show you how that looks right now. So I'll sign out. I'll log in into Red's account. I'm sorry, Jake's account.

2 minutos 43 segundos2:43
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 43 segundos
They get the notification over here. You've been added to to profit sharing, which is good. Now as soon as they get added over here because they already have access to it, some awards over here, they'll be able to see the documents over here and everything related to that.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 3 segundos
On awards, I was able to remove the KPIs as we discussed, and then as soon as we gave them an award over here, they'll be able to see their own awards instead of like the the company's awards and share profits.
BT

3 minutos 18 segundos3:18
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 18 segundos
I'll log out and I'll go back into the admin account.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 25 segundos
Sharing now there I'm just gonna take the example of this one because I don't want to create a from from the scratch a new a new plan. But then as soon as you click I I'll change I change this save and close as you requested it as well.
BT
Brett Tatum
3 minutos 39 segundos3:39
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 39 segundos
Yeah, I like it. Yep.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 41 segundos3:41
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 41 segundos
Mm-hmm. As soon as you click finalize, I added a little spinning thingy over here because it's going to take a few seconds to generate the document. Soon as it's generated, it's gonna take you back over here. And now the most important thing, I'm still fighting with some of the formatting and at the moment the only issue I currently have is.
BT
Brett Tatum
3 minutos 49 segundos3:49
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 49 segundos
3 minutes? Yep.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
4 minutos 1 segundo4:01
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 1 segundo
The first page is blank, which for some reason it doesn't wanna. I I still haven't been able to figure out how to remove it from the.
BT
Brett Tatum
4 minutos 8 segundos4:08
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 8 segundos
Yeah, and and that's because it's the Word doc. It's the the Word doc I even sent you was like that. So what we want to do, Mateo, is take that original Word doc that I sent you and just copy it all and paste it in a new Word doc without a blank first page.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
4 minutos 12 segundos4:12
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 12 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 19 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 22 segundos
In a new one. OK, sounds good, but everything else is exactly the same formatting as it was, which is much better. Now you have the numerals at the beginning I what I did.
BT
Brett Tatum
4 minutos 25 segundos4:25
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 25 segundos
I should have done that originally.
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 29 segundos
That looks good.
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 32 segundos
Yes, mhm.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
4 minutos 37 segundos4:37
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 37 segundos
I built the function originally to render on the client side, basically on your browser. Now everything's on the server side, so it never touches the app. So it's basically created everything under Firebase. So it's much cleaner, much quicker, much better. It's against error proof, so it's good, it's better.
BT
Brett Tatum
4 minutos 48 segundos
Mateo Roldan Taborda
4 minutos 57 segundos4:57
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 57 segundos
Now it doesn't clip at the bottom of the pages and at the beginning of the pages either. Everything is exactly as you left it on the original side. The other thing that I'm still fighting about for some reason, the signatures don't want to change font, so basically it doesn't want to change to cursive or the elegant font.
BT
Brett Tatum
5 minutos5:00
Brett Tatum 5 minutos
Yep.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
5 minutos 17 segundos5:17
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 17 segundos
Pretty much to say, so I'm still fighting against that. I'm trying to figure out how to how to do it, but it's.
BT
Brett Tatum
5 minutos 20 segundos5:20
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 20 segundos
Just.
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 22 segundos
Just do this. Just do this. Just remove, remove the signature block entirely. Just get rid of it.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
5 minutos 25 segundos5:25
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 25 segundos
OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 28 segundos
OK, sounds good. That'll make everything much easier and but as soon as you issue and as soon as you create a new private plan, everything's state stamped. So it's still works as a signature that cannot be removed.
BT
Brett Tatum
5 minutos 32 segundos5:32
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 32 segundos
Yeah, just remove it.
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 43 segundos
Yep.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
5 minutos 43 segundos5:43
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 43 segundos
Now let's go to the stakeholders over here. We're going to create a new stakeholder. Again, I'll use the Brett one. You have the Brett because the full name, which is set up that way under your profile. If you change it, it will change to whatever you put it over there over here, but in this case.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 16 segundos6:16
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 16 segundos
And then save. As soon as I click save, you see now the name is exactly as you pasted it over there, as you whatever you put the name over here. If you leave it as the default, it's going to be the default name. But anyway.
BT
Brett Tatum
6 minutos 24 segundos6:24

Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 32 segundos6:32
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 32 segundos
As soon as you go to to Brett, we'll give him an award based on the tactical. It worked. You already tested the functionality. You can write it down over here so it works. I'm just going to quickly select random dates.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 48 segundos6:48
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 48 segundos
OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 49 segundos
I'll say 500 shares.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 53 segundos
And I'll issue. Then again you got the loading spinning ball over here saying generating document. While it loads, it takes just one second. Great. Issued by me, the account holder. And again, here you go. The the format is better, more elegant.
BT
Brett Tatum
6 minutos 57 segundos6:57

Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 16 segundos7:16
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 16 segundos
But again, signatures still, yeah, I'll remove them. I'll add one for Jake as well. So I you can see what I want to show you here as well because this is a very neat feature.
BT
Brett Tatum
7 minutos 19 segundos7:19
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 19 segundos

Brett Tatum 7 minutos 29 segundos

Mateo Roldan Taborda

Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 31 segundos
Jake, Jake, something is going to be the manager. He's not gonna have a manager.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 41 segundos
Now Jake will issue also an award for him.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 47 segundos
Just run.
BT
Brett Tatum
7 minutos 47 segundos7:47
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 47 segundos
Did uh is the manager a required field or did you just leave it blank on Jake?
Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 51 segundos7:51
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 51 segundos
I love the blank on Jake. You can add because I just wanna show you a functionality over here. Let's go into one.
BT
Brett Tatum
7 minutos 53 segundos7:53
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 53 segundos
OK, OK.
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 59 segundos
Yeah, no, that's fine. Well, everything that's left, I mean, I'll still be able to see everyone's right. Like I don't have to be selected as a manager to see everyone's. OK, just double check.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 5 segundos8:05
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 5 segundos
Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 7 segundos
Yeah, very good.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 9 segundos
So let us wait. Now you see everything over here. He's issued everything. You'll see some of these fields a little bit distorted, but just because my screen is smaller over here, it's going to be fine. Valuations is still exactly the same, but now the important change you'll be able to select from all of the companies over here.
BT
Brett Tatum
8 minutos 26 segundos8:26
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 26 segundos
Yeah, there we go. Cool.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 29 segundos8:29
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 29 segundos
As well, right? So for the Florida one, as soon as you click on it, it will change and it will change the entire company. So if you go back to settings, you'll see that the one that is selected is the Florida one. So it pretty much works as changing just companies over here, which is good. You'll be able to see instead of them all of them.
BT
Brett Tatum
8 minutos 39 segundos8:39
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 39 segundos
Yeah.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 48 segundos8:48
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 48 segundos
Stacking on top of each other, you'll be able to see each of them individually. Trigger tracking. Still, this is for me. I need it to connect everything on the app and now going back to the Jake's account so you can visualize everything.

Hello.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
9 minutos 18 segundos9:18
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 18 segundos
Going back to his account. Now the important thing, because he's a supervisor and he has somebody below him, he'll he'll be able to see the person below him in all. In my awards, only his awards and then my team only the people below him.
BT
Brett Tatum
9 minutos 28 segundos9:28
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 28 segundos

Brett Tatum 9 minutos 34 segundos
Yeah, it's great.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
9 minutos 34 segundos9:34
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 34 segundos
And then as soon you like, if you want to see the people below him, he can still go to here. He can accept the award for the other person as well. He will get the signature will be under him, not the other person's. But still he has the possibility of doing that, but he cannot edit anything.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 52 segundos
Underneath. But that's not what I want to show you over here. Again, he cannot edit anything over here, not even the roles. So I'm thinking about deleting the details on the on the users because there's honestly not much they can do. But anyway, on his own.

ateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 14 segundos10:14
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 14 segundos
Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 18 segundos
Oh, OK, so no, I was just going back to Jake's own awards, not his themes. So he'll go over here. He'll go accept a word. As soon as he accepts, he's going to get the timestamp and the signature over here. Again, everything works perfectly over here. He'll be he'll be able to.
BT
Brett Tatum
10 minutos 23 segundos10:23

Brett Tatum 10 minutos 29 segundos
Yep.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 38 segundos10:38
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 38 segundos
To see his signature over here, but I'll remove that as discussed. And again, just payout history over here. A little bit more details, price per share, share system might have paid out everything, the dates, so pretty much everything he needs.
BT
Brett Tatum
10 minutos 53 segundos10:53
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 53 segundos
Yeah, so let's talk about the KPI figures here at the top. So um.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 56 segundos10:56
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 56 segundos
Yep.
BT
Brett Tatum
11 minutos11:00
Brett Tatum 11 minutos
These so when when in the user looking at team awards or the individuals users like personal awards, I want all the KPIs to be around the money that they will receive and I think I told you so this I I may be changing from what I said previously but as opposed to saying like next period estimated profit, it'd be like next period estimated.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
11 minutos 7 segundos11:07
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 7 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
11 minutos 20 segundos11:20
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 20 segundos

Mateo Roldan Taborda
11 minutos 21 segundos11:21
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 21 segundos
Heyo, OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
11 minutos 23 segundos11:23
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 23 segundos
Which, which then would be like in this case, Jake has, I think he gave him 600 shares. So it'd be 600 shares time, you know, doing the math to say, hey Jake, you're actually set to, you know, you'll get to potentially receive $1500.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
11 minutos 35 segundos11:35
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 35 segundos
Mm-hmm. Estimated plan. Yeah, of course. So we need, yeah, I definitely need to change the the wording on that.
BT
Brett Tatum
11 minutos 36 segundos11:36
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 36 segundos
Um.
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 44 segundos
Yeah.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda

Got it.
BT
Brett Tatum
11 minutos 46 segundos11:46
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 46 segundos
Um.
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 48 segundos
So yeah, like the last quarter, it wouldn't be extra to the last quarter payout annual payout total.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
11 minutos 57 segundos11:57
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 57 segundos
Mm-hmm. So it will be the future.
BT
Brett Tatum
11 minutos 58 segundos11:58
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 58 segundos
Like you got, yeah. So like this next estimated profit payment, that's actually, that's the figure like that's correct. That figure's good. So I kinda like.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos 2 segundos12:02
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 2 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 6 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 10 segundos12:10
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 10 segundos
Maybe to set up so next year, next period estimated profit, I think keep that. I still think that's a good metric.
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 17 segundos
Then the next metric would be this next estimated profit payment and then we have last quarter profit payment, annual profit payment total.
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 28 segundos
Total.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos 28 segundos12:28
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 28 segundos

MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos 32 segundos12:32
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 32 segundos
OK, sounds good. Yeah, definitely. I can make that change happen for you. Yeah, I'll make sure to change the KPS for the next round of changes. All right, moving on over here. So if you are added again as a user, as a supervisor.
BT
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 42 segundos12:42
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 42 segundos
OK.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos 51 segundos12:51
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 51 segundos
Or anything else in the company profits. If you are added into multiple companies, you'll be able to see only the ones that you're currently added. So in this case, Florida and OKC, right? And OKC, same thing, you'll be able to see the metrics for that company as well as you requested it, which is good.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 11 segundos
And yeah, that's pretty much it from all of the changes that we do. Mm-hmm.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 12 segundos13:12
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 12 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 14 segundos
No, that's great. No, because it looks great. The two things. So we just talked about KPIs. I still really would like to get our usernames and everything updated and cleaned up just so that's all pulling through correctly.

Apologize. Apologize. Yeah, I think we've got, I mean, I think we're we're in really good shape. So I think what I'm going to do now is kind of do a little bit of back testing. So I'm gonna set up some like 2025 awards and like kind of.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 5 segundos14:05
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 5 segundos
Yeah, of course.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 9 segundos
Mm-hmm. So yeah, we need, we need those. So some of the KPIs are going to be filling and they can see that information too, right? I'm gonna use you for anything that I possibly have missed, which is a possibility as well. Any bugs, any.

Brett Tatum 14 minutos 49 segundos
Uh.
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 59 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 2 segundos
Awesome. Yep, I will do that back testing over the next couple days and catch any bugs. I'll just probably fire them over to you right away. But this is cool. I think this is a great, great platform. We could sell this, buddy. We could find someone else who would want this and make a bunch of money.

Mateo Roldan Taborda

Brett Tatum 15 minutos 23 segundos
But some things OK, so this would be something that I I I know you probably got just a little bit more clean up on this or if you do.
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 33 segundos
We need to pivot a little bit on bolt to work across all of our companies. So this this is gonna be minor, but like we have it, you know, it says Tatco construction and it's got the Tatco logo.

Brett Tatum 15 minutos 49 segundos
We need to. So I'll come up with a like a bolt logo if you will, or if you have the ability to kind of program this thing where they have to select the company that they work for, like when they set up their profile, we can kind of white label this for each of our companies. Does that make sense?

Let's let's strip like the Tatco branding 'cause I'm looking here. The only thing on here that makes it a Tatco is the little logo, very small logo on the left. Well, it's bigger when you expand out the the options, but the Tatco logo in the top left and then I also see it in my like little browser tab.

Brett Tatum 17 minutos 43 segundos
Yeah, and so don't go wrong, did nothing wrong on your end. But what I'll do here is I'm going to quickly create a little generic logo and we'll just use a generic kind of bolt bolt logo for right now. Then we don't have to worry about the branding and stuff. That can be a project.

Mateo Roldan Taborda 18 minutos 3 segundos
Mm-hmm. We can definitely do that. In the meantime, also for the profit sharing pages, you said that you wanted to start creating all of the plans for all of the different companies as well. So at the moment on the state that the.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 18 minutos 17 segundos
App is you can start doing that. All of the all of the future changes I'm going to be adding into these pages are just going to be minor design things, pretty much figuring out removing the first page, which is not gonna be affecting any other plans or anything like that. So yeah, just.
BT
Brett Tatum
18 minutos 20 segundos18:20
Brett Tatum 18 minutos 20 segundos

18 minutos 35 segundos18:35
Mateo Roldan Taborda 18 minutos 35 segundos
You you can start doing everything you want, adding the people you want to as well. The very next thing that I will actually suggest let me focus my time on is creating the the capability of adding people from bolt without having to rely on on Firebase. So I'm sure.

Brett Tatum
18 minutos 39 segundos18:39
Brett Tatum 18 minutos 39 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 18 minutos 50 segundos

Brett Tatum 18 minutos 53 segundos
I like that.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
18 minutos 55 segundos18:55
Mateo Roldan Taborda 18 minutos 55 segundos
I'm sure I can get that done in just a day or two because I need to build everything on the back end. So I will need to go back to Firebase and create everything over there for us to be able to add pretty much everybody. So I'm guessing all of the companies we're going to be adding.
BT
Brett Tatum
19 minutos 2 segundos19:02
Brett Tatum 19 minutos 2 segundos
