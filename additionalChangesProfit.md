You're you're just just fine. So the download. My preference would be for the download to be a PDF. I wasn't sure. OK, great.
MT

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 18 segundos1:18
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 18 segundos
It's going to be on PDF. There's another, there's a, there's another thing you should know about that because when you see it like that, it automatically falls back as a draft, right? So you'll see as a document. So you'll you're able to make changes or you're able to request me to make changes into that document.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 37 segundos
Get out of that box, click on the X or close whatever. Go to the click on finalize or save any of them or cancel even. It doesn't really matter.

So just just.
Brett Tatum 2 minutos
Yes, so for what it's worth. So when I click, so I click this when I hit save.
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 8 segundos
It kicks me out of it. I would think that when you hit save, it doesn't shouldn't close you out of it.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
2 minutos 15 segundos2:15

Let's just say it. No, that's a good. Yeah, that's a good request, yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
2 minutos 18 segundos2:18
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 18 segundos
Yeah. Or if you want to, I mean, or I don't care, you should say, should say save and close. So you know that you're going to get get closed out of it, which is fine because you can get right back into it now. Yep.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
2 minutos 32 segundos2:32
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 32 segundos
We'll take a second.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 35 segundos
Yeah, and now click on the. Do you see the little eye icon right next to the trash bin? Now it's completely finalized on PDF with all of the fields you wanted to add over there completely customized.

Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 55 segundos
Now I do have a little bit of an issue over there and it's the formatting changing from changing from docs to PDF. The way I'm doing it, it's a bit difficult to control the formatting. I'm trying my best.
BT
Brett Tatum
3 minutos3:00
Brett Tatum 3 minutos
Uh, OK.
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 7 segundos
Oh yeah, I see your formatting's getting.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 9 segundos3:09
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 9 segundos
A bit chopped at parts, but for the 90% of it, it's good, but it's something that I'm still working on. It's something that's a bit difficult to to to get.
BT
Brett Tatum
3 minutos 12 segundos3:12
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 12 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 20 segundos
Well, if it needs to stay, if it needs to stay a docx file or something else to make it cleaner for a while, if that's the easiest path forward, that's OK, but OK, so that that's great.

Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 26 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 30 segundos
OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 36 segundos
And it's dynamically changed. It's going to be changing all of those little inserts that we put over there, company name, dates, they're all going to be automatically changed depending on what the profit plan you're creating is and.

Brett Tatum
3 minutos 50 segundos3:50
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 50 segundos
OK.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 53 segundos3:53
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 53 segundos
Pretty much all the inputs you placed over there, so.
BT
Brett Tatum
3 minutos 56 segundos3:56
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 56 segundos
OK, now do I have the ability to sign this plan now that it's been finalized?
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
4 minutos 3 segundos4:03
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 3 segundos
You could, but I didn't thought we wanted to sign the the plan itself.
BT
Brett Tatum
4 minutos 10 segundos4:10
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 10 segundos
Well, I do just as the here, let me go back. Sorry. Uh.
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 17 segundos
Like this, the document calls for my at least my signature here. Not the not the stakeholders, but just mine.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
4 minutos 21 segundos4:21
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 21 segundos
OK, I can definitely add that.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 25 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
4 minutos 28 segundos4:28
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 28 segundos
We could even do something, Mateo, if it was easier, like once I hit finalize, it just adds my signature to it if that's a a possibility.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
4 minutos 34 segundos4:34
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 34 segundos
Mm-hmm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 37 segundos
Yeah, of course I I already added that functionality, but in the other one, so I'll show you in a second. Yeah, the stakeholders.
BT
Brett Tatum
4 minutos 42 segundos4:42
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 42 segundos
And the stakeholders, OK, so yeah, um.
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 48 segundos
OK, so this this made sense to me. So then I get down to stakeholders and I'm going to delete this because this is what I already created. Let me do it again. OK, so I do have some changes I'd like to see on the stakeholders. OK, so select users from bolt.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
4 minutos 52 segundos4:52
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 52 segundos
Hmm.
BT
Brett Tatum
5 minutos 4 segundos5:04
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 4 segundos
I You might be able to tell me why some are first names and some are e-mail addresses.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
5 minutos 9 segundos5:09
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 9 segundos
Yeah, so pretty much whenever you see an e-mail is because the user hasn't changed, hasn't placed their name in the in their profile. So exit that little button over there. I'll show you where they'll have like as soon as they they receive an invitation to join Bolt.
BT
Brett Tatum
5 minutos 17 segundos5:17
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 17 segundos
OK.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
5 minutos 24 segundos5:24
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 24 segundos
They usually should go to their profile in the top right corner of the of Vault.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 29 segundos
Click on profile and if they haven't placed their name on the field first name.
BT
Brett Tatum
5 minutos 36 segundos5:36
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 36 segundos
OK.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
5 minutos 37 segundos5:37
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 37 segundos
So the the other field there it's going to default to their e-mail, so you'll see their e-mail instead of their name.
BT
Brett Tatum
5 minutos 42 segundos5:42
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 42 segundos
Gotcha.
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 45 segundos
OK, so.
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 48 segundos
Just consider like this is something we should change. Let's just make this first name and last name and then their username will just be their first name and last name combined.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
5 minutos 53 segundos5:53
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 53 segundos
OK, yeah, for sure.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 58 segundos
OK, sounds good. I can definitely do that. I added username because they can use the username to log in into Boltu.
BT
Brett Tatum
5 minutos 59 segundos5:59
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 59 segundos
Uh, OK, that's fine. So I just was.
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 6 segundos
Oh, we'll just always tell them they log in with their e-mail address. That'll just be. We'll just tell them that's the case. OK, so we had the stakeholder. So let's just say I'm gonna go grab me 'cause makes it easy.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 10 segundos6:10
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 10 segundos
Sounds good. Perfect.
BT
Brett Tatum
6 minutos 23 segundos6:23
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 23 segundos
Full name. OK, so in my mind ideally if they've got it filled out, it'll just pull in their full name. But in this case we don't have it. So now do you not need first name and last name for any type of the coding or anything like that? Or is it? Are you good just having a single?
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 30 segundos6:30
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 30 segundos
Yeah, it is.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 41 segundos
No.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 42 segundos
It's the same, so if you'd rather have just one name or both names, it's going to be the same thing. In coding standpoints I can use I I have methods of joining things, so it's not gonna be an issue in the future.
BT
Brett Tatum
6 minutos 42 segundos6:42
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 42 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 49 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 54 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 57 segundos
OK, let's remove title as a as a selection here e-mail address. I assume that defaults, so that's just fine. We'll need that phone number. I would eliminate this. That's not really needed.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 59 segundos6:59
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 59 segundos
Sounds good.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 5 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 10 segundos
Sounds good.
BT
Brett Tatum
7 minutos 11 segundos7:11
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 11 segundos
There's just one more thing that's gonna deal with. Employment status, remove that pay type, remove that and pay amount, remove that. We don't really need to capture that, but one field I do need to capture is their supervisor.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 20 segundos7:20
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 20 segundos
Sounds good.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 27 segundos
Supervisor.
Brett Tatum
7 minutos 28 segundos7:28
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 28 segundos
Or their manager. So I would actually call it manager and in this case manager. I need to be able to select that from the user list in bolt because one thing we will need to do is the managers will need to be able to see all of their direct reports.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 42 segundos7:42
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 42 segundos
Hmm, OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
7 minutos 44 segundos7:44
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 44 segundos
So like Simon Cox has four or five people that'll be in the profit sharing. I want to make sure he's able to have visibility to his team.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 52 segundos7:52
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 52 segundos
OK, got it. Absolutely. I do have a question about that. Did we already added all of the all of those peoples into Bolt? Because you gave me a big list. I'm not sure if they're included there.
BT
Brett Tatum
8 minutos 6 segundos8:06
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 6 segundos
Yeah, all your supervisors are in there, at least at this point. Um, but not all of the employees are in yet.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 15 segundos8:15
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 15 segundos
Yeah, let me know who is a supervisor over there, or if all of them are supervisors so I can change.
BT
Brett Tatum
8 minutos 21 segundos8:21
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 21 segundos
I don't even do that. I would just can I just get the full user list as an option to select from? Yeah, because it'll just be me. So I I don't care. I mean, like, yeah, some of them aren't supervisors, but I can make.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 27 segundos8:27
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 27 segundos
OK, of course, of course.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 30 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 35 segundos
Because from a coding standpoint over there, we'll need to know who is admin, basically you and me, who is supervisor that will have like the view. They'll need the permission to be able to see who is underneath them, because at the moment there's only two users, admin and user.
BT
Brett Tatum
8 minutos 42 segundos8:42
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 42 segundos
Oh, 'cause they'll be, Yep.
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 47 segundos
Yes.
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 50 segundos
Yeah, maybe a third.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 51 segundos8:51
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 51 segundos
The users don't are not able to see pretty much anything. The admins can see everything. Supervisors are going to be kind of like a halfway point where they're basically going to be able to see people below them.
BT
Brett Tatum
9 minutos 3 segundos9:03
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 3 segundos
Yep. OK. So yes, we will need that then is.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
9 minutos 7 segundos9:07
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 7 segundos
I'll need to know who is going to be a supervisor and then I can add that feature inside them.
BT
Brett Tatum
9 minutos 12 segundos9:12
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 12 segundos
OK, perfect. I will. I'll get that to you.

Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 44 segundos
It could all be all random. It doesn't really matter, yeah.
Brett Tatum
9 minutos 46 segundos9:46
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 46 segundos
Yeah, that's all right. I'll just get it all filled in 'cause it does require all those fields be saved. So OK, so I'm gonna go save. OK, so now I'm in there and then.

Edit.
Brett Tatum 10 minutos
Add a new award. Take that from Tatco profit sharing. This would be helpful if I could either type in a date here or select it from the calendar it. If I can't, that's OK, but like I can't click on this and just type the date.
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 15 segundos
I have to click on the calendar, which is fine.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 17 segundos10:17
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 17 segundos
Oh, it's. So you want to write out, write down the date.
BT
Brett Tatum
10 minutos 21 segundos10:21
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 21 segundos
If I can do an either or, it'd be great. If I can't do either or, typing the dates a little easier 'cause like in this case I go to January, but then if the end of it's next year, I have to click.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 34 segundos10:34
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 34 segundos
You can select the month and the year over there too if it makes it easier.
BT
Brett Tatum
10 minutos 38 segundos10:38
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 38 segundos
How do I? Oh, OK, so I go December 26. OK, maybe that's easy enough. OK, that's easy enough. I'll just plan on doing that.

Brett Tatum 10 minutos 49 segundos
Yep. Um, I didn't know I could do that. So then one one through 1231 triggers 90,000 shares. Let's just go 500 K and then I'm gonna final. Do you want me to finalize or save? What do you think would be better to do it?
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
11 minutos 1 segundo11:01
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 1 segundo
You can do both. Click on view draft first as well. You'll be able to see the document as well with the with the fields that were kind of like customized over there so you know what you're getting into. Click close over there.

Brett Tatum
11 minutos 49 segundos11:49

Yeah, let me get back into it 'cause I hit save and then.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda

Brett Tatum 11 minutos 55 segundos
What was this?
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos12:00
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos

BT
Brett Tatum

Brett Tatum 12 minutos 5 segundos
Yeah.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos 8 segundos12:08
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 8 segundos
And then you have two options because you're currently an admin. You can sign for the user or the user. Again, I'm having a little trouble with the formatting over there, which is always a little bit annoying when converting from Word to PDF, yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 24 segundos
Hmm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 25 segundos
The user can do the same thing too, but there you go. You'll have an item on the top right corner that says signed by Brett and then signature at the bottom. Brett a little bit more up over there.
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 37 segundos12:37
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 37 segundos
OK, yeah 'cause this will sign. Well this OK, I think that I I would've I needed to sign as the like administrator 'cause I'm logged into my Reddit Tatco.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos 39 segundos12:39
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 39 segundos
Which is?
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 51 segundos
Yeah, but at the moment, oh, I see. So the the admin, you need both the admin and the user to to sign these.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 2 segundos13:02
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 2 segundos
Yes. So, um, OK, let's talk about this. I think this is a good, good discussion point. So I'm gonna close out of this.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 12 segundos13:12
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 12 segundos
But.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 13 segundos13:13
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 13 segundos
I think we'll need three different statuses here. We'll need draft, we'll need issued, and then we'll need finalized. So what I would think we would have here.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 17 segundos13:17
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 17 segundos
OK, mm-hmm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 20 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 21 segundos
Got it.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 26 segundos13:26
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 26 segundos
Is when I fill all this out, I should have a button as the administrator, the admin that says issue. What that's going to do is that I mean to me it should be as easy as like that puts my signature on it and then puts it in the user's kind of like.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 35 segundos13:35
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 35 segundos
Sure.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 41 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 46 segundos
Got it.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 47 segundos13:47
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 47 segundos
Platform to then go in and they will then once they review it, they hit finalize.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 53 segundos13:53
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 53 segundos
Interesting.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 55 segundos13:55
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 55 segundos
Or accept maybe is a way to do it and once they accept it, I would say like like is it possible just to have that accept put their signature on?
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 5 segundos14:05
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 5 segundos
If you want to do it by for the user, you could, and that's kind of like what you just did there. But yeah, it makes sense what you're asking for the moment. So whenever you issue it, your signature will be placed at the bottom over there.
BT
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 19 segundos14:19
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 19 segundos
Uh huh.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 20 segundos14:20
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 20 segundos
As you just pointed out, and then it will be notified to the user, which we already do, asking them to to sign the document as well. Yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 27 segundos14:27
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 27 segundos
Yep.
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 31 segundos
To accept it, basically, yeah, you have a new award to accept, kind of.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 35 segundos14:35
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 35 segundos
Mm-hmm.
BT
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 37 segundos14:37
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 37 segundos
But you know.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 37 segundos14:37
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 37 segundos
Yeah, so you you already have that functionality, so just exit this model just real quickly.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 45 segundos

Brett Tatum 16 minutos
Yep.
Brett Tatum 16 minutos 4 segundos
That's perfect. That's perfect. And so, yeah.
Brett Tatum 16 minutos 11 segundos
Great. Yeah, this is, this is fantastic. And so just a little improvement we talked about there this at at this case it would say like issued.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
16 minutos 19 segundos16:19
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 19 segundos
Instead of finalize exactly.
BT
Brett Tatum
16 minutos 20 segundos16:20
Brett Tatum 16 minutos 20 segundos
Yep. And then at that point they would have probably 2 actions, view document and accept, accept award.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
16 minutos 28 segundos16:28
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 28 segundos
Document and that will place their signature on them on the doc.
BT
Brett Tatum
16 minutos 31 segundos16:31
Brett Tatum 16 minutos 31 segundos
And then when they hit accept, that'll lace their signature on it.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
16 minutos 34 segundos16:34
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 34 segundos
Yes, mm-hmm.
BT
Brett Tatum
16 minutos 37 segundos16:37
Brett Tatum 16 minutos 37 segundos
And then I would assume if I went back into the admin side and at that point I could see.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
16 minutos 44 segundos16:44
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 44 segundos
Mm-hmm. You'll be able to see the the document that they signed.
BT
Brett Tatum
16 minutos 45 segundos16:45
Brett Tatum 16 minutos 45 segundos
Yeah, so.
Brett Tatum 16 minutos 48 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 16 minutos 52 segundos
Yeah, so I have an active stakeholder right here.
Brett Tatum 16 minutos 57 segundos
And yeah, I would see it.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
16 minutos 59 segundos16:59
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 59 segundos
Mm-hmm. Exactly. So you'll be able to see that now. I'll give you a second over there.
BT
Brett Tatum
17 minutos 7 segundos17:07
Brett Tatum 17 minutos 7 segundos
OK.

Brett Tatum

Brett Tatum 17 minutos 12 segundos
Yep.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
17 minutos 14 segundos17:14
Mateo Roldan Taborda 17 minutos 14 segundos
For you to be able to see how much you're going to be paying your stakeholders, you need to add a profit entry, right? So at the end of the quarter, select a plant.
BT
Brett Tatum
17 minutos 19 segundos17:19
Brett Tatum 17 minutos 19 segundos
Yep.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
17 minutos 24 segundos17:24
Mateo Roldan Taborda 17 minutos 24 segundos
At the end of one of those quarter, you'll be manually entering the the amount over there and depending on upon what kind of profit plan you selected, again you'll have the calculation being different if it's.
BT
Brett Tatum
17 minutos 36 segundos17:36
Brett Tatum 17 minutos 36 segundos
Yep.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
17 minutos 39 segundos17:39
Mateo Roldan Taborda 17 minutos 39 segundos
Share profits Bob Trigger again, it's going to be profit amount minus Trigger amount divided by the total shares and if it's share total profits, it's going to be the profit amount divided by the total shares.
BT
Brett Tatum
17 minutos 46 segundos17:46
Brett Tatum 17 minutos 46 segundos
Perfect.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
17 minutos 57 segundos17:57
Mateo Roldan Taborda 17 minutos 57 segundos
And you can click on the on the profile which is the pen on the action.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 18 minutos 7 segundos
You'll be able to see how much you're going to be paying him and when.
Brett Tatum
18 minutos 11 segundos18:11
Brett Tatum 18 minutos 11 segundos
** made a profit payment. OK, $500. Um.
Brett Tatum 18 minutos 18 segundos
OK, so this was gonna be.
Brett Tatum 18 minutos 22 segundos
The question I had for you 'cause this is a functionality I would like to have. So for back over here on valuations.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
18 minutos 29 segundos18:29
Mateo Roldan Taborda 18 minutos 29 segundos
Yes.
BT
Brett Tatum
18 minutos 31 segundos18:31
Brett Tatum 18 minutos 31 segundos
Do you think there's any way we can have an estimated profit and then kind of like a finalized or actual profit? Here would be my kind of logic or my thought behind this is like, OK, we're sitting here before the first quarter.
Brett Tatum 18 minutos 49 segundos
And I'm talking to that team and they're saying, hey, Brett, we think we're going to make $150,000 this quarter. I would like to be able to put that number in as kind of an estimate because then everyone on that team can say, oh, OK, well.
Brett Tatum 19 minutos 4 segundos
If we, you know, if we do hit our goal of 150,000, I'm going to make a $5000 bonus.
Brett Tatum 19 minutos 12 segundos
So my thought would be is that we would go, you'd click, you know, add profit just like we did. We have profit plan, profit date.
Brett Tatum 19 minutos 23 segundos
I think this can go away. We don't. I don't think we need source being manual or anything else because it'll just be what it is. So it'll always be manual, but almost like right here we'd have an option. Say is this.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
19 minutos 27 segundos19:27
Mateo Roldan Taborda 19 minutos 27 segundos
OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 19 minutos 30 segundos
Hmm.
BT
Brett Tatum
19 minutos 37 segundos19:37
Brett Tatum 19 minutos 37 segundos
Actual profit is just estimated profit.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
19 minutos 40 segundos19:40
Mateo Roldan Taborda 19 minutos 40 segundos
So instead of source being manual, just an option saying type of profit estimate or actual profit.
BT
Brett Tatum
19 minutos 48 segundos19:48
Brett Tatum 19 minutos 48 segundos
Yes. And then uh.
Brett Tatum 19 minutos 53 segundos
So then nothing changes here and so you'd hit, you know, you'd hit the add profit, but then so we've got this one in here. You would be able to go into it and edit it and change it from estimated to actual and then just update it.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
20 minutos 8 segundos20:08
Mateo Roldan Taborda 20 minutos 8 segundos
Would you like a reminder before the end date comes?
BT
Brett Tatum
20 minutos 13 segundos20:13
Brett Tatum 20 minutos 13 segundos
No, I don't. I won't need that because the end date will actually come and go before I'm able to put it in because we won't know it until like 30 days after.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
20 minutos 15 segundos20:15
Mateo Roldan Taborda 20 minutos 15 segundos
OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 20 minutos 21 segundos
OK, OK, sounds good.
BT
Brett Tatum
20 minutos 23 segundos20:23
Brett Tatum 20 minutos 23 segundos
So don't worry about that, that we'll have plenty of re reminders on that, but then on the.
Brett Tatum 20 minutos 30 segundos
Employee side and I might be able to see it here when I go just look at stakeholders. So I go here.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
20 minutos 36 segundos20:36
Mateo Roldan Taborda 20 minutos 36 segundos
OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
20 minutos 37 segundos20:37
Brett Tatum 20 minutos 37 segundos
And edit. I would picture two different things here. Next, next.
Brett Tatum 20 minutos 48 segundos
I would call this next period estimated.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
20 minutos 51 segundos20:51
Mateo Roldan Taborda 20 minutos 51 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
20 minutos 52 segundos20:52
Brett Tatum 20 minutos 52 segundos
Which would be kind of the estimate that we have out there.
Brett Tatum 20 minutos 58 segundos
I would have a yes and then uh.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
20 minutos 59 segundos20:59
Mateo Roldan Taborda 20 minutos 59 segundos
Not the actual profit, yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
21 minutos 5 segundos21:05
Brett Tatum 21 minutos 5 segundos
Then the next then this box over here would say uh.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
21 minutos 10 segundos21:10
Mateo Roldan Taborda 21 minutos 10 segundos
Another Ki.
BT
Brett Tatum
21 minutos 11 segundos21:11
Brett Tatum 21 minutos 11 segundos
Preferably that date. So actually we shouldn't do last or next, we should use the date. So if I have a if I have the.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
21 minutos 13 segundos21:13
Mateo Roldan Taborda 21 minutos 13 segundos
OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
21 minutos 20 segundos21:20
Brett Tatum 21 minutos 20 segundos
If it was the 331, it would be 331 estimated profit pulls through right here and then the next little icon or the next data point we would have which would kind of be like the last quarters.
Brett Tatum 21 minutos 36 segundos
Actual profit. So I guess I should use it 331. Let's just say this is like this is the 630. This is the Q2 profit. So it'd be 6/30/2026 estimated profit and give you this and this one would be like the 331 actual profit.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
21 minutos 37 segundos21:37
Mateo Roldan Taborda 21 minutos 37 segundos
Mm-hmm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 21 minutos 47 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
21 minutos 52 segundos21:52
Brett Tatum 21 minutos 52 segundos
Payment. Does that make sense?
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
21 minutos 53 segundos21:53
Mateo Roldan Taborda 21 minutos 53 segundos
Got it. Yeah. So you will always be able to see two KPIs, one with the estimate and one with the actual number.
BT
Brett Tatum
22 minutos22:00
Brett Tatum 22 minutos
Exactly.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
22 minutos 1 segundo22:01
Mateo Roldan Taborda 22 minutos 1 segundo
But this in this case, because this is going to be the very first entry, you will only see the estimate and when the other one is available and it will appear over there.
BT
Brett Tatum
22 minutos 10 segundos22:10
Brett Tatum 22 minutos 10 segundos
Exactly, yeah. Or if you need to leave leave a placeholder for it, it can just say 0 because there is no previous. Yeah, so I would if there's nothing for it to grab, just use zero and then.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
22 minutos 15 segundos22:15
Mateo Roldan Taborda 22 minutos 15 segundos
OK, sounds good. Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 22 minutos 19 segundos
Just zero. Gotcha.
BT
Brett Tatum
22 minutos 25 segundos22:25
Brett Tatum 22 minutos 25 segundos
The third KPI that would be nice to see is the annual total, so like awards to date.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
22 minutos 32 segundos22:32
Mateo Roldan Taborda 22 minutos 32 segundos
Got it.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 22 minutos 35 segundos
But the awards giving or the total amount of profit there?
BT
Brett Tatum
22 minutos 41 segundos22:41
Brett Tatum 22 minutos 41 segundos
I would say AC actuals.
Brett Tatum 22 minutos 45 segundos
So just actual is not dealing with estimate at all.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
22 minutos 45 segundos22:45
Mateo Roldan Taborda 22 minutos 45 segundos
OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 22 minutos 47 segundos
OK. Actual profit made throughout the whole year.
Brett Tatum
22 minutos 51 segundos22:51
Brett Tatum 22 minutos 51 segundos
Yep, Yep. So you know, if I'm towards the end of the year and we had a $500 payment, a $750 payment, you know my total would be 12150 for the year, I would have a next an upcoming estimate.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
22 minutos 52 segundos22:52
Mateo Roldan Taborda 22 minutos 52 segundos
Got it.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 23 minutos 3 segundos
Got it.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 23 minutos 6 segundos
Got it. You got it. That can be added.
BT
Brett Tatum
23 minutos 6 segundos23:06
Brett Tatum 23 minutos 6 segundos
And then my last one.
Brett Tatum 23 minutos 10 segundos
OK. Um.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
23 minutos 13 segundos23:13
Mateo Roldan Taborda 23 minutos 13 segundos
But just one thing over there in.
BT
Brett Tatum
23 minutos 13 segundos23:13
Brett Tatum 23 minutos 13 segundos
Oh yeah, and there it is. Yeah, you've got the estimated. You've already got the date on there, so maybe just kinda reformatting the yeah.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
23 minutos 17 segundos23:17
Mateo Roldan Taborda 23 minutos 17 segundos
Yeah, it's just the difference exactly. One more thing that I would like to actually explain to you over there in valuations.
BT
Brett Tatum
23 minutos 25 segundos23:25
Brett Tatum 23 minutos 25 segundos
Mhm.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
23 minutos 29 segundos23:29
Mateo Roldan Taborda 23 minutos 29 segundos
You will start seeing a more, much more attractive kind of like graphic over there. The more profit entries you add, you only see one, so it's just one dot. But let's say you have 10 profits over the year you'll start seeing on different over different dates you start seeing.
BT
Brett Tatum
23 minutos 37 segundos23:37
Brett Tatum 23 minutos 37 segundos
Yeah. Uh-huh. Yes.
Brett Tatum 23 minutos 41 segundos
One dot. Yeah, I kind of.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
23 minutos 48 segundos23:48
Mateo Roldan Taborda 23 minutos 48 segundos
An actual grahic come along.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 23 minutos 55 segundos
There you go. And the more you add, you'll store seeing more curves and everything and you even have the plus 50% increase in profit. So kind of like an interesting view for you over there to see.
BT
Brett Tatum
23 minutos 56 segundos23:56
Brett Tatum 23 minutos 56 segundos
Cool. Yep.
Brett Tatum 24 minutos 1 segundo
Yeah, that.
Brett Tatum 24 minutos 10 segundos
This graph right here would also be nice for our stakeholders to see.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
24 minutos 12 segundos24:12
Mateo Roldan Taborda 24 minutos 12 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 24 minutos 16 segundos
Oh, OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
24 minutos 17 segundos24:17
Brett Tatum 24 minutos 17 segundos
And not based, not necessarily their awards, but the actual like kind of profit of the company, just like that exact graph I think would be valuable is another KPI look.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
24 minutos 23 segundos24:23
Mateo Roldan Taborda 24 minutos 23 segundos
OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 24 minutos 26 segundos
Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 24 minutos 28 segundos
The graphic on valuation on the stakeholder for everybody who's a stakeholder.
BT
Brett Tatum
24 minutos 32 segundos24:32
Brett Tatum 24 minutos 32 segundos
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I think this would be good for. I mean, frankly, this screen right here, maybe, maybe that's what it is. Maybe the the users just get access to this tab. They can't add anything. They have no like.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
24 minutos 39 segundos24:39
Mateo Roldan Taborda 24 minutos 39 segundos
Hmm.
BT
Brett Tatum
24 minutos 50 segundos24:50
Brett Tatum 24 minutos 50 segundos
They just get they can view it.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
24 minutos 51 segundos24:51
Mateo Roldan Taborda 24 minutos 51 segundos
Oh, OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 24 minutos 53 segundos
But for their specific company, right? They won't have any. OK, OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
24 minutos 57 segundos24:57
Brett Tatum 24 minutos 57 segundos
Yes, yeah, exactly. They're company only.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
25 minutos25:00
Mateo Roldan Taborda 25 minutos
OK, sounds good. Now next will be on trigger tracking. It's changed everywhere so you won't see milestones anywhere, not even in the code if you start reading. So I made sure I changed every references from milestones.
BT
Brett Tatum
25 minutos 7 segundos25:07
Brett Tatum 25 minutos 7 segundos
2.
Brett Tatum 25 minutos 10 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 25 minutos 16 segundos
So I was thinking about this. Mateo, do we need this anymore?
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
25 minutos 20 segundos25:20
Mateo Roldan Taborda 25 minutos 20 segundos
I do. I I do. So it's nice for me to be able to see because trigger tracking is the thing I use to connect everything together. And it's just it was a nice for me to be able to see it too, for me to be able to connect everything together as well. Like there's no much for you to do here. It's just.
BT
Brett Tatum
25 minutos 21 segundos25:21
Brett Tatum 25 minutos 21 segundos
You do. OK, that's fine.
Brett Tatum 25 minutos 31 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 25 minutos 35 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 25 minutos 38 segundos
Fair enough.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
25 minutos 39 segundos25:39
Mateo Roldan Taborda 25 minutos 39 segundos
See like the profit plans across everything, but it's nice for me because I'm using a lot of things behind the back end to be able to connect everything.
BT
Brett Tatum
25 minutos 48 segundos25:48
Brett Tatum 25 minutos 48 segundos
Let's leave it then. I don't have a problem with it. I just was thinking like I'm putting the trigger in on the plan. Do I need it over there also? But all good. And then we know settings.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
25 minutos 54 segundos25:54
Mateo Roldan Taborda 25 minutos 54 segundos
There.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 25 minutos 57 segundos
You can select comanies, you can add a company, click on add user.
BT
Brett Tatum
26 minutos 3 segundos26:03
Brett Tatum 26 minutos 3 segundos
I'm sorry, what did you say click on?
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
26 minutos 5 segundos26:05
Mateo Roldan Taborda 26 minutos 5 segundos
Add user to the right. Yep, you can now add. Also, let's say you have one employee on multiple companies. So for example, I don't know, click anyone.
BT
Brett Tatum
26 minutos 15 segundos26:15
Brett Tatum 26 minutos 15 segundos
Mhm.
Brett Tatum 26 minutos 18 segundos
Yeah, why don't I just do my my my one again.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
26 minutos 20 segundos26:20
Mateo Roldan Taborda 26 minutos 20 segundos
Yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
26 minutos 25 segundos26:25
Brett Tatum 26 minutos 25 segundos
Oh, it's that option.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
26 minutos 26 segundos26:26
Mateo Roldan Taborda 26 minutos 26 segundos
Because you already have him at it.
BT
Brett Tatum
26 minutos 29 segundos26:29
Brett Tatum 26 minutos 29 segundos
Is it because I have matted here?
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
26 minutos 31 segundos26:31
Mateo Roldan Taborda 26 minutos 31 segundos
Yeah, no, no, no. But because you already add him into as a as another user. So exit the add user access model, click on cancel or anything, click on remove or edit.
BT
Brett Tatum
26 minutos 37 segundos26:37
Brett Tatum 26 minutos 37 segundos
OK.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
26 minutos 49 segundos26:49
Mateo Roldan Taborda 26 minutos 49 segundos
Just click on cancel over there. Remove access to to that account.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 26 minutos 57 segundos
Remove then add them again.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 27 minutos 4 segundos
And then you can select multiple companies over there too.
BT
Brett Tatum
27 minutos 6 segundos27:06
Brett Tatum 27 minutos 6 segundos
Uh, cool. OK, yeah, I like that.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
27 minutos 7 segundos27:07
Mateo Roldan Taborda 27 minutos 7 segundos
You'll be able to see them on on top as well, like if you need, if there's an employee across multiple companies, which I bet you do have, it could happen. You are going to be able to add them to multiple ones and they'll be able to see the information regarding all of the.
BT
Brett Tatum
27 minutos 11 segundos27:11
Brett Tatum 27 minutos 11 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 27 minutos 15 segundos
It could happen, yeah.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
27 minutos 25 segundos27:25
Mateo Roldan Taborda 27 minutos 25 segundos
Profit plans they're added at or all of their awards on their user. I also make sure if you in the future somebody's fired or somebody leaves the company as well, if you remove access from them over here, even if they have a notification active that says hey you're.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 27 minutos 42 segundos
You're allowed to enter to the profit train pages. They're completely blocked. They won't be able to access it. Nobody will be able to dig it inside over there, over there.
BT
Brett Tatum
27 minutos 54 segundos27:54
Brett Tatum 27 minutos 54 segundos
But when I add a stakeholder at this page, it's gonna default to whatever company I'm selected. So like you know it's gonna, it's gonna add the user to tackle construction OKC when I'm.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
27 minutos 56 segundos27:56
Mateo Roldan Taborda 27 minutos 56 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 28 minutos 1 segundo
Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 28 minutos 4 segundos
You'll need to change automatically, like you'll need to manually select which company you're going to be adding the thing and then you can actually add the user. Another important thing over here because I haven't built that for the moment being, remember to always add the user.
Brett Tatum
28 minutos 9 segundos28:09
Brett Tatum 28 minutos 9 segundos
Yes, yes.
Brett Tatum 28 minutos 12 segundos
OK, Yep.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
28 minutos 21 segundos28:21
Mateo Roldan Taborda 28 minutos 21 segundos
And then you can you can still create a stakeholder and a word for the stakeholder, but if you haven't added the user over here in user management, they won't be able to see anything.
BT
Brett Tatum
28 minutos 31 segundos28:31
Brett Tatum 28 minutos 31 segundos
Oh, OK, so I have to add it to places. I have to add it here and then I have to add stakeholders.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
28 minutos 34 segundos28:34
Mateo Roldan Taborda 28 minutos 34 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 28 minutos 36 segundos
Yeah, you can add the stakeholder first, but they won't be able to access anything. They need to be added over here as well for them to be able to access profit training pages.
BT
Brett Tatum
28 minutos 38 segundos28:38
Brett Tatum 28 minutos 38 segundos
The plans, OK.
Brett Tatum 28 minutos 43 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 28 minutos 48 segundos

I mean the the whole PDF thing, the whole, it's dynamic now, pretty much meaning you'll be able to, you won't have to worry about dealing with dates or anything like that. It's added. I do have the few things you wanted to change over there with the signatures.

Brett Tatum 28 minutos 59 segundos
Yeah.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
29 minutos 10 segundos29:10
Mateo Roldan Taborda 29 minutos 10 segundos
So I'll be working on that too. Um.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 29 minutos 13 segundos
I mean, we talked for about half an hour, but it's just a few action points that need to be added over there, so I think.
BT
Brett Tatum
29 minutos 18 segundos29:18
Brett Tatum 29 minutos 18 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 29 minutos 20 segundos
Very happy with it. I'm very happy. Um.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
29 minutos 21 segundos29:21
Mateo Roldan Taborda 29 minutos 21 segundos
Not 100 sure.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 29 minutos 24 segundos
Either Friday or Monday, I'll be able to have the changes you requested today, so we're gonna be good.
BT
Brett Tatum
29 minutos 27 segundos29:27
Brett Tatum 29 minutos 27 segundos
OK. And again, I don't, I don't know what your usability is on some of this. Um.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
29 minutos 35 segundos29:35
Mateo Roldan Taborda 29 minutos 35 segundos
What do you mean?
BT
Brett Tatum
29 minutos 36 segundos29:36
Brett Tatum 29 minutos 36 segundos
Sorry, not usability. Uh, your the ability on the programming. So if I go.

Brett Tatum 29 minutos 47 segundos
Oh, I forgot how to sign this. How do I sign the document?
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
29 minutos 51 segundos29:51
Mateo Roldan Taborda 29 minutos 51 segundos
Oh, click on the eye icon. I know it's not very intuitive, but yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
29 minutos 53 segundos29:53
Brett Tatum 29 minutos 53 segundos
Yeah, icon. That's right. No, that's fine. Um, when I click sign.
Brett Tatum 30 minutos 1 segundo
Is it possible for the little script signature to actually show up?
Brett Tatum 30 minutos 7 segundos
Like.
Brett Tatum 30 minutos 9 segundos
Because this.
Brett Tatum 30 minutos 14 segundos
Yeah, something's a little bit off here on the format.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
30 minutos 18 segundos30:18
Mateo Roldan Taborda 30 minutos 18 segundos
Yeah, it's a bit tricky. That's the thing that it's taking me the most time. It's formatting on on docs because I'm taking the template you gave me and then putting them on PDF all through.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 30 minutos 29 segundos
All all through code. It's a bit difficult to to change that. Initially we can place the probably like this, the formatting a bit off, but then I'll make sure to work on that so that I can get it better.
BT
Brett Tatum
30 minutos 32 segundos30:32
Brett Tatum 30 minutos 32 segundos
Yeah, so.
Brett Tatum 30 minutos 40 segundos
OK, yeah, so the way this is kind of reading, the way it should be is like, so taco construction, OK, CLLC, like my signature would go here. Now in this case, Brett Tatum is also the person getting awarded the document.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
30 minutos 49 segundos30:49
Mateo Roldan Taborda 30 minutos 49 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
30 minutos 57 segundos30:57
Brett Tatum 30 minutos 57 segundos
Their signature would go here. We I don't think we need this managing member employee Brett Tatum's signature.
Brett Tatum 31 minutos 7 segundos
Just trying to see. I can't remember what I sent you.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
31 minutos 11 segundos31:11
Mateo Roldan Taborda 31 minutos 11 segundos
I have it right here if you want to for me to share it to you.
BT
Brett Tatum
31 minutos 14 segundos31:14
Brett Tatum 31 minutos 14 segundos
Yeah, share it to me.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
31 minutos 16 segundos31:16
Mateo Roldan Taborda 31 minutos 16 segundos
Of course, one second.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 31 minutos 30 segundos
And then?
Mateo Roldan Taborda 31 minutos 33 segundos
There you go.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 31 minutos 35 segundos
Just sent them sent them through the chat.
Brett Tatum
31 minutos 37 segundos31:37
Brett Tatum 31 minutos 37 segundos
Oh, you said.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
31 minutos 40 segundos31:40
Mateo Roldan Taborda 31 minutos 40 segundos
Because there's two, I always forget which which one of them.
BT
Brett Tatum
31 minutos 41 segundos31:41
Brett Tatum 31 minutos 41 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 31 minutos 44 segundos
You're good.
Brett Tatum 31 minutos 53 segundos
OK, so.
Brett Tatum 31 minutos 56 segundos
That does seem a little different than what I sent you.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
32 minutos 3 segundos32:03
Mateo Roldan Taborda 32 minutos 3 segundos
Am I omuting anything over there?
BT
Brett Tatum
32 minutos 6 segundos32:06
Brett Tatum 32 minutos 6 segundos
What's that?
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
32 minutos 8 segundos32:08
Mateo Roldan Taborda 32 minutos 8 segundos
No, I'm asking if I if I omitted anything on the documents.
BT
Brett Tatum
32 minutos 13 segundos32:13
Brett Tatum 32 minutos 13 segundos
Yeah, maybe. I'm just pulling up the one that I sent you just to see what it looked like.
Brett Tatum 32 minutos 29 segundos
OK, yeah, the four. OK, so the format. OK, so let me let me share here real quick just so you see what I'm looking at.
Brett Tatum 32 minutos 37 segundos
So this is that last the the signature page on this.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
32 minutos 43 segundos32:43
Mateo Roldan Taborda 32 minutos 43 segundos
No company name.
BT
Brett Tatum
32 minutos 43 segundos32:43
Brett Tatum 32 minutos 43 segundos
Company name that needs and you did that right. So that came through correct on. Hold on just a second, let me get back to.
Brett Tatum 32 minutos 56 segundos
Bold.
Brett Tatum 33 minutos
You got that right. Company name came across.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
33 minutos 3 segundos33:03
Mateo Roldan Taborda 33 minutos 3 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
33 minutos 4 segundos33:04
Brett Tatum 33 minutos 4 segundos
And then the idea is that I would sign as the company representative on that line with my printed name underneath it.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
33 minutos 13 segundos33:13
Mateo Roldan Taborda 33 minutos 13 segundos
Uh, OK, yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
33 minutos 14 segundos33:14
Brett Tatum 33 minutos 14 segundos
But if that becomes too complicated, get rid of my printed name. I don't care. Then this is I did mess this up. I apologize this that needs to just get deleted.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
33 minutos 18 segundos33:18
Mateo Roldan Taborda 33 minutos 18 segundos
OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 33 minutos 28 segundos
Managing member OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
33 minutos 28 segundos33:28
Brett Tatum 33 minutos 28 segundos
Yeah, that that needs to go away. Oh, what happened?
Brett Tatum 33 minutos 36 segundos
Yeah, the managing member piece just needs to go.
Brett Tatum 33 minutos 40 segundos
That's not that's my fault. That's bad formatting on my end. And then the employee signature like their.
Brett Tatum 33 minutos 52 segundos
Really, I should have done it more like this.
Brett Tatum 33 minutos 55 segundos
Like the employee name now.
Brett Tatum 34 minutos 9 segundos
I'm really making this confusing. I apologize.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
34 minutos 12 segundos34:12
Mateo Roldan Taborda 34 minutos 12 segundos
No, no worries. I get the gist of it. So but instead of employee name, it's going to be their signature or employee name and signature.
BT
Brett Tatum
34 minutos 21 segundos34:21
Brett Tatum 34 minutos 21 segundos
Yeah, so ideally it'd be something like this where like.
Brett Tatum 34 minutos 26 segundos
This is my name. I sign it here on behalf of the company. The employee signature falls in this area right here and then their name gets populated below it based on the.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
34 minutos 37 segundos34:37
Mateo Roldan Taborda 34 minutos 37 segundos
Got it. So let me ask you something over there because the line that you put over there, it's a bit tricky to to put over there. Can I change that and instead put like employee name and then right next to it kind of like in cursive?
Mateo Roldan Taborda 34 minutos 54 segundos
Their signature or does it have?
BT
Brett Tatum
34 minutos 56 segundos34:56
Brett Tatum 34 minutos 56 segundos
Let's do this. I don't think you know, Mateo, this is this is a lot of work for something that's really not providing any value. Let's get rid of the signature pages. Let's just let's just get rid of that because we have documentation here.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
35 minutos 6 segundos35:06
Mateo Roldan Taborda 35 minutos 6 segundos
OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 35 minutos 7 segundos
OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
35 minutos 11 segundos35:11
Brett Tatum 35 minutos 11 segundos
Of like you're able to capture this somewhere like you can almost timestamp like OK, this award was issued by Brett Tatum. I click the issue, right? And then you can see when they accepted it by when they click it. And let's just let's just get rid of that signature block.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
35 minutos 20 segundos35:20
Mateo Roldan Taborda 35 minutos 20 segundos
Yep.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 35 minutos 24 segundos
OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 35 minutos 26 segundos
Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 35 minutos 29 segundos
OK, sounds good. Thanks. Yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
35 minutos 29 segundos35:29
Brett Tatum 35 minutos 29 segundos
So let's get it rid of. Let's get rid of it there, and then let's also get rid of it.
Brett Tatum 35 minutos 36 segundos
Um.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
35 minutos 36 segundos35:36
Mateo Roldan Taborda 35 minutos 36 segundos
Yeah, because the little item you see over there, like a signature pending, whenever you sign the document, it says signed, it has a timestamp, it has automatically, everything's automatic over there and there's absolutely no way like it's going to be hacked or anything like that.
BT
Brett Tatum
35 minutos 39 segundos35:39
Brett Tatum 35 minutos 39 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 35 minutos 44 segundos
Great.
Brett Tatum 35 minutos 54 segundos
Yeah, yeah, and I'm.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
35 minutos 56 segundos35:56
Mateo Roldan Taborda 35 minutos 56 segundos
Oh.
BT
Brett Tatum
35 minutos 57 segundos35:57
Brett Tatum 35 minutos 57 segundos
I'm good with that. So let's let's do that and then even on the award.
Brett Tatum 36 minutos 3 segundos
Hold on, I'm gonna pull back up what you sent me here real quick. So then we've got.
Brett Tatum 36 minutos 10 segundos
This one here. See if I wanna change anything on this. Then we're still trying to get that blank front page off. That's my fault.
Brett Tatum 36 minutos 17 segundos
Uh.
Brett Tatum 36 minutos 25 segundos
Yeah, let's just let's just get rid of this. Let's just get rid of this whole little section right here.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
36 minutos 30 segundos36:30
Mateo Roldan Taborda 36 minutos 30 segundos
Sounds good, but it's still going to be signed by you.
BT
Brett Tatum
36 minutos 32 segundos36:32
Brett Tatum 36 minutos 32 segundos
That goes away.
Brett Tatum 36 minutos 35 segundos
Effectively by when I finalize it, right? Yeah, yeah, we're just not going to go through the effort of trying to create a little cursive signature on there and have to deal with all the formatting.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
36 minutos 38 segundos36:38
Mateo Roldan Taborda 36 minutos 38 segundos
Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 36 minutos 45 segundos
OK, good. Thank you. Because yeah, that's I it's. I know it seems simple, but it's a bit tricky to do on practice.
BT
Brett Tatum
36 minutos 47 segundos36:47
Brett Tatum 36 minutos 47 segundos
Sorry.
Brett Tatum 36 minutos 52 segundos
Oh, good. I'm hey, look, that's that's not necessary. So once it's finalized, they'll have that. We'll have.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
36 minutos 57 segundos36:57
Mateo Roldan Taborda 36 minutos 57 segundos
Mhm.

37 minutos 4 segundos37:04
Mateo Roldan Taborda 37 minutos 4 segundos
Everything ready? Yeah, retty much.
