Mateo Roldan Taborda 0 minutos 15 segundos
Awesome. So yeah, the only change that I make to the actual code over here is was that before you couldn't see the total amount of people over here. You could only see them after you select them by property. Now you can and you can select the property as well. I fixed the little bug that there was in the interaction between these two and all my.

My other work was focused on documenting pretty much everything I've done over the past few weeks up to a month. I'm good enough. I'm almost done. I've just a little bit off yet on that. It's just, yeah, there's a lot, but I'm good to go to whatever else we need.

Great.
Brett Tatum 0 minutos 45 segundos
It's a lot, isn't it?
Brett Tatum 0 minutos 54 segundos
OK, yeah, why don't I share my? Yeah, let me share my screen.
MT

Mateo Roldan Taborda
0 minutos 54 segundos0:54
Mateo Roldan Taborda 0 minutos 54 segundos
On development as well. So let me know what? Yeah, please.
BT

Brett Tatum
1 minuto1:00
Brett Tatum 1 minuto
Um.
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 2 segundos
OK, so just looking at our kind of development tracker here, I've got it consolidated down by status. And then the team and I, we added a few things and then gave them some priorities. These three things weren't really like projects. They kind of were.
MT

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 15 segundos1:15
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 15 segundos
Awesome.

Brett Tatum
1 minuto 26 segundos1:26
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 26 segundos
Um. So if any, if there's any updates that need to be done there, feel free to make it over here on the status. Um.
MT

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 33 segundos1:33
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 33 segundos
Sounds good. On those ones, yeah, those three I haven't touch it at all because how the the focus of the project changed to profit sharing on the last month and so, so yeah.
BT

Brett Tatum
1 minuto 44 segundos1:44
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 44 segundos
You did get this. You got that one taken care of though, didn't you? Or are you still working on it?
MT

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 47 segundos1:47
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 47 segundos
That one I did, yes. No, no, no. That one I did. We we deleted everything. That's. I'll just change the column for that one.
BT
Brett Tatum
1 minuto 50 segundos1:50
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 50 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 52 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 53 segundos
All good.
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 55 segundos
Yeah, that's fine. OK, well, the other two we'll just leave kind of is out there without a without a priority right now. These are gonna be the first two that we want to take on. So warranty tracker, warranty tracker, I'm gonna say this, it should be.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
2 minutos 1 segundo2:01
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 1 segundo
OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 5 segundos
Sounds good.
BT
Brett Tatum
2 minutos 11 segundos2:11
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 11 segundos
A relatively kind of easy lift or or development piece. Um.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
2 minutos 13 segundos2:13
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 13 segundos
Hmm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 16 segundos
Sounds good.
BT
Brett Tatum
2 minutos 17 segundos2:17
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 17 segundos
The.
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 21 segundos
Warranty tracker that we currently use.
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 32 segundos
It's just an Excel sheet.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
2 minutos 34 segundos2:34
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 34 segundos
Awesome.
BT
Brett Tatum
2 minutos 35 segundos2:35
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 35 segundos
OK, location description is requested by assigned to start date percent complete. This is not. We don't need to do anything with that status. I don't even know what we're putting in status, but anyways, all it is is a is a central place for our warranty request to.
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 54 segundos
B.
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 56 segundos
Uh, tracked.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
2 minutos 58 segundos2:58
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 58 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
3 minutos3:00
Brett Tatum 3 minutos
Obviously this very easily I think can can push into bolt. I would say some functionality I would like to see is the not so this says location. Really what this should say is.
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 13 segundos
Robably roject.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 14 segundos3:14
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 14 segundos
Mm-hmm.
BT
Brett Tatum
3 minutos 16 segundos3:16
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 16 segundos
And so this would be a situation where it's like, go ahead.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 16 segundos3:16
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 16 segundos
Do they?
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 18 segundos
Do they connect to actual projects in Master Tracker?
BT
Brett Tatum
3 minutos 23 segundos3:23
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 23 segundos
Yes. So I was hoping we could just pull from the master tracker project. So when someone goes to enter a new record, a new warranty request, they would just select from, you know.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 29 segundos3:29
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 29 segundos
Huh.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 33 segundos
Oh.
BT
Brett Tatum
3 minutos 39 segundos3:39
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 39 segundos
We we can talk about details, but they'd be able to select from the master tracker list of projects.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 44 segundos3:44
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 44 segundos
OK, awesome.
BT
Brett Tatum
3 minutos 47 segundos3:47
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 47 segundos
Description is kind of a free form. What is the?
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 53 segundos
What is the issue requested by? So this is another free form. Um.
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 2 segundos
Entry here. Who's it assigned to? This is gonna be an internal.
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 7 segundos
Person or people. So this would be probably kind of like a multiple selection type deal where whoever's entering this can assign it to the people they need to be assigned to.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
4 minutos 9 segundos4:09
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 9 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 12 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 16 segundos
Any specifics like only a specific people or is it going to be from people who are already registered on Bolt so I can pull that data from there?
BT
Brett Tatum
4 minutos 26 segundos4:26
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 26 segundos
Already already registered in Bolt. Yeah, the whoever, whoever is gonna get these requests will already be in Bolt, or if they're not, they will be added.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
4 minutos 28 segundos4:28
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 28 segundos
OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 32 segundos
All right.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 34 segundos
Sounds good. And then just kind of like an obvious question, but I feel like I really need to ask it. This is only going to be 4 roles in TADCO, OKC and Florida, right?
BT
Brett Tatum
4 minutos 36 segundos4:36
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 36 segundos
Anything.
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 46 segundos
No, I would like to see what our options are about making this for all companies because all companies have warranty.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
4 minutos 47 segundos4:47
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 47 segundos
OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 56 segundos
Oh, OK, interesting.
BT
Brett Tatum
4 minutos 57 segundos4:57
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 57 segundos
Needs and requests.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
5 minutos5:00
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos
Hmm.
BT
Brett Tatum
5 minutos 3 segundos5:03
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 3 segundos
Now the issue like our you know FD on the mark, they don't have a master cracker.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
5 minutos 9 segundos5:09
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 9 segundos
Yeah, no. Or like the the only company that currently has a master tracker is OKC, but I gave it as well to Florida because I'm guessing both of them are connected just like different places of business.
BT
Brett Tatum
5 minutos 10 segundos5:10
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 10 segundos
We don't have a real effective way.
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 16 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 24 segundos
Yep, Yep.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
5 minutos 25 segundos5:25
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 25 segundos
OK, so here's what I'm thinking. Maybe may I share my screen just to bounce ideas here?
BT
Brett Tatum
5 minutos 31 segundos5:31
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 31 segundos
Uh, yeah, yeah.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
5 minutos 34 segundos5:34
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 34 segundos
Let me know once more you see my whenever you see my screen.
BT
Brett Tatum
5 minutos 38 segundos5:38
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 38 segundos
Gotcha. You've got kind of like a coding box open there on the right. It's just making it a little bit smaller.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
5 minutos 45 segundos5:45
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 45 segundos
Oh, the console. Yeah, there we go. So I'm just going to take as an example because what I was thinking before you said that is that I'm probably just going to be adding ONT as a kind of like a side tab over here, kind of like we have overview, task, attachments, activities, right?
Brett Tatum
5 minutos 49 segundos5:49
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 49 segundos
There you.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 4 segundos6:04
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 4 segundos
But if we're going to use it with the other companies as well, maybe I can add it as a complete new page over here where Home, CRM, Master Tracker, all of those leave, right? So maybe what I can do is probably add it there.
BT
Brett Tatum
6 minutos 16 segundos6:16
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 16 segundos
Think so.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 19 segundos6:19
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 19 segundos
And connected to the actual list of master tracker. Probably I'll ull UA list of the current rojects over here and then in set.
BT
Brett Tatum
6 minutos 29 segundos6:29
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 29 segundos
That would be pretty. That would be pretty cool if it could then tie to that project and somewhere within that project you could see like all of the warranty.
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 38 segundos
Records that were created for it.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 40 segundos6:40
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 40 segundos
So kind of like these, like you'll be able to see project number, project, probably that's it. All we need for to identify a project filters as well. If we need more, we'll add them on the go.
BT
Brett Tatum
6 minutos 51 segundos6:51
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 51 segundos
Mhm, yeah.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 55 segundos6:55
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 55 segundos
But then as soon as you open that specific project, instead of seeing all of these, you're only going to be seeing whatever we're going to be creating for a project warranty. And then whenever you save it, it's going to save under that project just in different pages. So that way we can segregate.
BT
Brett Tatum
6 minutos 56 segundos6:56
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 56 segundos
Yep.
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 12 segundos
Yep.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 13 segundos7:13
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 13 segundos
Multiple companies in the future. So for example, whenever we create, I don't know, master tracker or an equivalent for FD companies, we can segregate like we'll have a separate kind of like CRM and we'll also have a warranty tracker for whatever we add over there. Make sense.
BT
Brett Tatum
7 minutos 20 segundos7:20
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 20 segundos
Mhm, Yep.
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 31 segundos
Makes sense. So here is going to be the technical piece on this that I would like this. This is going to be used I think in different modules down the road. The big piece of the warranty tracker is integration with Outlook or I want it to be.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 33 segundos7:33
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 33 segundos
Yes.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 40 segundos
Hmm.
BT
Brett Tatum
7 minutos 49 segundos7:49
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 49 segundos
I want to tap in integration with Outlook where like once a warranty is created in here. Um.
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 58 segundos
Whoever it's assigned to can be sent an e-mail with notice of the warranty request.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 2 segundos8:02
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 2 segundos
Oh, kind of like what we do already. Let me show you. Maybe this is something that you want.
BT
Brett Tatum
8 minutos 7 segundos8:07
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 7 segundos
I think in our notifications is we've already kinda got a piece already built out for this.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 11 segundos8:11
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 11 segundos
Yeah, but for example, like whenever, like whenever we create a new project inside of Bolt, I get these neat emails.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 21 segundos
Your project, something like that. It's up. You can like view project or whatever added. We can completely modify these emails as well. I'm not sure if you're getting them. Oh OK, that's good to know.
BT
Brett Tatum
8 minutos 23 segundos8:23
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 23 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 27 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 29 segundos
Yes, and so I'm not. So that's something to look into. I didn't know those existed. I need to know. I see the notifications within Bolt, but I have not been receiving the emails.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 37 segundos8:37
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 37 segundos
Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 40 segundos
Yep.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 41 segundos
OK, I'll yeah, I had no idea. Honestly, this has been app since we created Master Tracker, but yeah, I'll.
BT
Brett Tatum
8 minutos 45 segundos8:45
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 45 segundos
OK, so no, yeah. And I knew there was some settings and stuff, so I I I know I'm not getting him blocked. I don't see him getting filtered, so I must just not be receiving him.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 55 segundos8:55
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 55 segundos
Yeah, I'll I'll modify it because you should be getting them as well, because that's something I honestly had no idea you didn't.
BT
Brett Tatum
9 minutos 1 segundo9:01
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 1 segundo
Sure. OK. But like, so you know, you get an e-mail when it first was created, but then you'd get an e-mail like every five days until it was completed, right? So that way you constantly got the reminders. That's a big deal on our warranties is people forget about them.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
9 minutos 6 segundos9:06
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 6 segundos
Hmm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 11 segundos
Awesome.
BT
Brett Tatum
9 minutos 17 segundos9:17
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 17 segundos
So like they get assigned, oh shoot, I didn't do anything about that. Now it's in a month and the client's upset. So having that reoccurring reminder and maybe it's a maybe it's a a selection that can be made on the front end. Like, OK, send a reminder every five days on this or every three days.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
9 minutos 17 segundos9:17
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 17 segundos
OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
9 minutos 34 segundos9:34
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 34 segundos
Um, we can work through some of the specifics, but I think what I envision is almost a.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
9 minutos 39 segundos9:39
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 39 segundos
A really strong follow U system.
BT
Brett Tatum
9 minutos 42 segundos9:42
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 42 segundos
Yes, a strong follow up system. I mean in a in a.
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 48 segundos
Really perfect world.
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 52 segundos
We could have it also interact with our like outside parties too.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 6 segundos10:06
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 6 segundos
Hmm.
BT
Brett Tatum
10 minutos 6 segundos10:06
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 6 segundos
But we built 35 Dutch brothers, so we get lots of warranty requests from their team. Just built a lot of buildings.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 6 segundos10:06
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 6 segundos
Hmm.
BT
Brett Tatum
10 minutos 14 segundos10:14
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 14 segundos
The.
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 17 segundos
Warranty e-mail comes from Dutch Brothers and we have got them now where they do send that e-mail to. I mean, a lot of times I'll put a lot of people on it, but they're getting pretty good about sending the e-mail to warranty at tatco dot construction.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 32 segundos10:32
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 32 segundos
OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
10 minutos 33 segundos10:33
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 33 segundos
OK, so Michelle, who works in our office, she takes that e-mail and she's the one who's updating just the spreadsheet that I showed you earlier. What I would envision is that she gets the e-mail. I still think it makes sense for her to manually put it in.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 42 segundos10:42
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 42 segundos
Oh, OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 47 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
10 minutos 50 segundos10:50
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 50 segundos
But she puts it into bolt.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 54 segundos10:54
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 54 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
10 minutos 56 segundos10:56
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 56 segundos
And then what it does is it sends an e-mail internally to.
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 2 segundos
Our team like whoever's been assigned it. She's also able to put in the e-mail addresses of who it was requested by.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
11 minutos 3 segundos11:03
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 3 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 10 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
11 minutos 11 segundos11:11
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 11 segundos
And then they also kind of get an e-mail from Bolt that says, hey, a warranty request has been generated within our internal system.
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 20 segundos
Here's who's, you know, comes like, here's the problem that's been identified, here's who's working on it. Here's what our anticipated follow up date is. I don't know if we, I don't know if we want to go, if that's something we want to try to do or not. That might be kind of like a second like let's let's build it first.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
11 minutos 28 segundos11:28
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 28 segundos
Awesome.
BT
Brett Tatum
11 minutos 35 segundos11:35
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 35 segundos
And then let's see if maybe there's a a value to our team to have that that third party integration.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
11 minutos 35 segundos11:35
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 35 segundos
Mm-hmm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 42 segundos
Yeah, absolutely. So here's what I'm thinking about it. Of course everything's going to be based on the warranty sheet you just showed me, but I'm thinking about like linking it every project and making a way so that Michelle has either two options, either just update the sheet that she's currently controlling, which I'm guessing is.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 2 segundos
Is saved somewhere in the Microsoft company in a share folder. I can directly connect to it, so maybe once you update over there it can update bolt automatically.
BT
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 4 segundos12:04
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 4 segundos
Yeah, shared Boulder.
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 13 segundos
Yep. I don't like that. The sheet, the the sheet's gonna go away. I want the sheet gone. Yeah, so that's gone. We're not doing that anymore.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos 16 segundos12:16
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 16 segundos
OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 20 segundos
Sounds good. So then like everything will be on bolt, right? So I'm thinking somewhere that she can edit everything and then e-mail the team within bolt as well so she doesn't have to actually go anywhere. Everything centralized, everything centralized probably going to be creating as well kind of like a calendar option so you can visualize.
BT
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 31 segundos12:31
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 31 segundos
Exactly.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos 40 segundos12:40
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 40 segundos
Everything your schedule based on the warrants coming out coming in so she can create events and follow up accordingly as well and a very strong follow up notification system both internally, e-mail and if you want to SMS as well.
BT
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 57 segundos12:57
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 57 segundos
Yeah, that could be a could be some value there going via text message as well too. So I think the first thing is just kind of creating the the integration with master tracker and the the projects that exist creating a kind of an easy to use because what I envision is like you hit like add new warranty item.
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 16 segundos
And it is like it's a form that you can fill out. Pretty easy to fill form. You got some drop downs, you've got your user selection, you've got free forms to put in the description, maybe even a spot where you can attach the.
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 34 segundos
Original e-mail that was sent, you know, just to kind of store that record somewhere. Not not required.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 40 segundos13:40
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 40 segundos
How would you like to storage those as a PDF word?
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 43 segundos13:43
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 43 segundos
Oh, because we don't. We don't. Yeah, I mean, I I would just.
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 48 segundos
I would just assume that file would be saved to whatever file format that it was brought over in. So like if you save an e-mail, it's a dot. I think it's a dot EML file type. Yeah, but again, more of a wish list on that piece. It doesn't have to be that way, but we'd like the we'd like the sheet to go away.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 58 segundos13:58
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 58 segundos
I'll figure it out.
BT
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 8 segundos14:08
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 8 segundos
Um. And having it in bold, I think gives us a little bit more of an integration. Um.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 13 segundos14:13
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 13 segundos
Yeah, absolutely. Good news for you though, like the integration to save anything pretty much inside Bolt, it's already built, it's already existing within Master Tracker and CRM. So we'll just be pulling that up like that piece of code into here as well, creating the rules in Firebase and it will be good for you. We'll just integrate the specific format we need to save it on.
BT
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 20 segundos14:20
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 20 segundos
Right.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 33 segundos14:33
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 33 segundos

Brett Tatum

Brett Tatum 14 minutos 34 segundos
Yeah, um.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 35 segundos14:35
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 35 segundos
So.
BT
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 39 segundos14:39
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 39 segundos
That.
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 41 segundos
That's really it. I mean, like I said, this isn't, this isn't a big, this isn't a big one. This isn't, this isn't profit sharing.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 47 segundos14:47
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 47 segundos
Absolutely understandable. So let me.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 52 segundos
Let me put the picture for you. So you know, kinda like what's going to be my timeline over here. Very first thing I'm going to be starting warranty tracker as well. Gonna make sure that I have the correct fields, everything else. And then I'm going to do the requirement assessment pretty much meaning what do I need to build? How I'm going?

I'm going to build it and after that it should take me just half a day or something. Yeah, somewhere around half a day to to do so. I'm going to start creating the front end again. That's the way kind of like I like to plan things around when new features are being developed. First thing is going to be front end once we're happy with the front end.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 15 minutos 29 segundos
I'm going to start working on the technical staff, meaning that everything clicks together on the back end as well, and then we'll shift features, we'll change, we'll iterate. Allow me a sprint again.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 15 minutos 45 segundos
One week for the for the front end and one week for for the back end. Probably because this is a smaller feature, it's going to be less time, but just to be safe, let's separate a Sprint of two weeks just to make sure that we have everything on on the go.

OK, sounds good. And very last question over here, where do I have it? Just kind of like to get me started somewhat quickly over here. What would you like to see? When I link the projects, you'll most likely see something like these a bit different, but what would you?
Mateo Roldan Taborda 17 minutos 2 segundos
Like to see specifically the project name I'm guessing is one of the fields project number and what else? Just project.
BT
Brett Tatum
17 minutos 7 segundos17:07
Brett Tatum 17 minutos 7 segundos
Mhm.
Brett Tatum 17 minutos 8 segundos
No need for project number. I would just use project name, project name. So if you kind of then flashback. So really I mean the columns that you see on that warranty tracker I think should be the same columns. Now let's make some changes here. Why don't you start typing as maybe I'm reading here, but OK, so location is really going to be project name.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
17 minutos 38 segundos17:38

Brett Tatum 17 minutos 44 segundos
Don't. Yeah, don't. Do not worry about trying to match this. Don't try to put there's only in whatever there's seven or eight records here. Just act like this is only a template. Don't worry about the actual warranty items. We'll go populate it after the fact, or I can help you populate it with some real.

Mateo Roldan Taborda 18 minutos 8 segundos
Drive to leak. OK, sounds good. Yeah, but I was actually thinking about like if we have a project name over here, then as soon as you enter, that's when you see the details for the warranty. That way is a bit more organized and easier for me to build as well.

Mateo Roldan Taborda 18 minutos 32 segundos
OK, pretty much what he said is having kind of like a table over here where you see which project you're going to be working on for the warranty tracker and then as soon as you click on it then you'll see the warranty, like all of the fields for the warranty tracker and all of the actions possible to do within the warranty.
BT
Brett Tatum
18 minutos 49 segundos18:49
Brett Tatum 18 minutos 49 segundos
No, I don't want it that way. So how I would like it to be now, OK, I'm saying it's kind of 1/2 no.

When someone has a new warranty item, I just want them to be able to click, you know, a plus new warranty item. Kind of like, you know, you've got plus create project, you know, equivalent to something like that. OK, that's going to pull up a form exactly something similar to this.

Brett Tatum 19 minutos 11 segundos
And then you're gonna hit next and go to the steps and you're gonna save the save the new warranty item. OK, so then once that's created, then it gets added to the the list of open warranty items that you see.

On the on the screen so like then so you know you might only have six or seven listed here at any given time. Now once it's here you can click on it and make updates like I think there needs to be an option where it's you know you have like an add update.

Yeah, gotcha. Gotcha. Awesome. Yeah, it seems fairly easy. I'll get to it right away. It's actually pretty interesting. Yeah, I'll I'll make sure to ask you as many questions as I can come up.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 20 minutos 26 segundos
While I do the planning, which is going to be between today and before tomorrow noon, and then I'll get started on the front end.

Mateo Roldan Taborda 20 minutos 55 segundos
Hmm.

Brett Tatum
20 minutos 55 segundos20:55

MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
20 minutos 59 segundos20:59
Mateo Roldan Taborda 20 minutos 59 segundos
Awesome. Do we need very last question, I swear? Do we need to restrict the access to that page to anybody on Bolt or is it going to be like these ones which are kind of like free?
BT
Brett Tatum
21 minutos 12 segundos21:12
Brett Tatum 21 minutos 12 segundos
Wide open. Yeah, within the TACO, within the TACO team. And then like I said, I would like for this to be something we could add into the other companies. The only difference would be is they're not gonna be able to tie it to a like master tracker project. They're just gonna, it's gonna be a free form. They're just gonna be able to type in the name.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
21 minutos 13 segundos21:13
Mateo Roldan Taborda 21 minutos 13 segundos
Quite a company.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 21 minutos 26 segundos
Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 21 minutos 31 segundos
Awesome. It's going to be really easy, I assure you. For example, if we have a CRM page and you want to add it with completely new projects into a different company, it's a matter of minutes to be able to do that on my end. So it's not going to be difficult. The the the lengthy process per se will be just creating it.
