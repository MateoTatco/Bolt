```

### Query 8: Find projects that might be excluded
```sql
-- Find projects with unusual characteristics that might be filtered
WITH MostRecentArchive AS (
    SELECT 
        ProjectNumber,
        MAX(ArchiveDate) as LatestArchiveDate
    FROM dbo.ProjectProfitabilityArchive
    GROUP BY ProjectNumber
)
SELECT 
    ppa.ProjectNumber,
    ppa.ProjectName,
    ppa.ProjectRevisedContractAmount,
    ppa.ContractStatus,
    ppa.ProjectStage,
    ppa.IsActive,
    ppa.RedTeamImport,
    ppa.ProjectRevisedContractAmount - ppa.EstCostAtCompletion as CalculatedProjectedProfit,
    ppa.JobCostToDate
FROM dbo.ProjectProfitabilityArchive ppa
INNER JOIN MostRecentArchive mra 
    ON ppa.ProjectNumber = mra.ProjectNumber 
    AND ppa.ArchiveDate = mra.LatestArchiveDate
WHERE ppa.ProjectRevisedContractAmount IS NULL
   OR ppa.ProjectRevisedContractAmount <= 0
   OR ppa.ContractStatus = 'Not Awarded'
   OR ppa.ProjectStage = 'Bidding'
ORDER BY ppa.ProjectRevisedContractAmount DESC
```

## Next Steps

1. Run Query 1 to see if Active filter makes a difference
2. Run Query 2 to see ContractStatus distribution
3. Run Query 3 to see ProjectStage distribution
4. Run Query 4 to see if NULL exclusion helps
5. Run Query 5 to check Active + Approved combination
6. Run Query 6 to check if zero/negative values are excluded
7. Run Query 7 to check RedTeamImport filter
8. Run Query 8 to identify projects that might be filtered out

Compare each query result with Power BI values to find the matching combination.
