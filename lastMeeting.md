OK, so if I wanna look at stakeholders, so let's just start poking around. I apologize, I did not get a chance to kind of poke around like I I try to do. But um, OK, first thing, so if we go to edit.

Brett Tatum 0 minutos 34 segundos
See here where you've been issued an award. So if I edit that, OK, tackle profit sharing plan, award date, award end date.
Brett Tatum 0 minutos 48 segundos

Brett Tatum

Brett Tatum 1 minuto 1 segundo
This amount right here.
MT

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 4 segundos1:04
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 4 segundos
Yeah, that's supposed to be the the profit amount you should be hidden. Mm-hmm.
BT

Brett Tatum
1 minuto 9 segundos1:09
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 9 segundos
Yeah, the the the threshold. OK, but this should tie back to the plan. This shouldn't be a field that's filled in, correct?
MT

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 17 segundos1:17
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 17 segundos
Oh, OK. So I I was thinking over there that maybe we should, if we wanna set up something different over there, we could as well. But yeah, I can definitely make that change.
BT

Brett Tatum
1 minuto 27 segundos1:27
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 27 segundos
Yeah, I think this should pull from the plan, 'cause everyone's, you know, if you're part of that plan, it's, you know, everyone's gonna have the same threshold. Yep. OK. Um.
MT

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 32 segundos1:32
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 32 segundos
OK, that's going to be the same. Got it, got it, got it.

Brett Tatum
1 minuto 40 segundos1:40
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 40 segundos
Now the one thing I don't see on here is like a number of shares.
MT

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 45 segundos1:45
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 45 segundos
That's going to be set U on violations.

Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 52 segundos
Valuation. It's click on valuation. It still hasn't been done yet, so you're going to have like.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 2 segundos
No, no, no, never mind.
BT
Brett Tatum
2 minutos 5 segundos2:05
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 5 segundos
Yeah. So I think the value, this is where we would add in like each quarter I would go in and I'd give, you know, a valuation for each plan, but each stakeholder needs to have a specific number of shares.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
2 minutos 8 segundos2:08
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 8 segundos

Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 11 segundos

Of.
BT
Brett Tatum
2 minutos 21 segundos2:21
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 21 segundos
In the plan that they've been awarded. So here you would put like I suppose the milestones we need to have like number of shares issued. So this would be shares or profit shares, number of shares issued and it's like if there was 10,000 outstanding total shares.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
2 minutos 24 segundos2:24
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 24 segundos

In your award.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
2 minutos 46 segundos2:46
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 46 segundos
Yeah, you're right. I was thinking something different on valuations to to do, but no, you're right. I'll I'll change over here my milestones for for the awarded shares so it's easier for us to to keep track.
BT
Brett Tatum
2 minutos 56 segundos2:56

Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 1 segundo3:01
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 1 segundo
Yeah, I'll, I'll do that. And one more thing over there. Click again on the edit for the the person. I was thinking like the document one. I was thinking over there because I'm guessing you're going to make people sign a document where they're going to be acknowledging.

Brett Tatum

Yeah.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 17 segundos3:17
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 17 segundos
What are their shares or kind of like their responsibilities? It's exactly the same mere profit sharing document you showed me before. It's nothing different, but it's we're going to be able to delete it and add another one.
BT
Brett Tatum
3 minutos 27 segundos3:27
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 27 segundos

Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 33 segundos3:33
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 33 segundos
Yeah, it's just a placeholder for the moment.
BT
Brett Tatum
3 minutos 35 segundos3:35
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 35 segundos
Perfect. OK, yeah, we'll we'll work on that kind of the next step cause this at least the document that you have in here is the plan document, which is good cause they need to understand what plan document they're agreeing to and then they would also have.
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 51 segundos
Like their individual award issuance, which is the other document that I'd sent you.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 54 segundos3:54
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 54 segundos
Yes.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 57 segundos

MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
4 minutos 32 segundos4:32
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 32 segundos
Yeah, it's just because I don't have any other document on the. Yeah, it's a placeholder. So in this one you will see well like the new version, but for this one in the stakeholders page, every single stakeholder will see their individual one.

Mateo Roldan Taborda

And then click on details.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 14 segundos
Then you'll be able to edit the things over here. This is where we're going to be able to edit the permissions too. So for example, if another person is a user, they're only going to be able to to see. They're not going to be able to edit anything.

So that's the thing that's going to work. Plans, stakeholders and overview already saves in Firebase, which I know I said that I was going to be working on that kind of like back end later on this week, but it's somewhat a simple integration, so I did it already. So we're saving information.

Brett Tatum 5 minutos 48 segundos
OK, great.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
5 minutos 50 segundos5:50
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 50 segundos
Like globally now for me pending it will be finishing building evaluations, milestones and settings and actually connecting those to the other tabs, which is probably I said I was going to take until Friday, probably is going to take me a little bit less.
BT
Brett Tatum
5 minutos 52 segundos5:52
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 52 segundos
OK.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 8 segundos6:08
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 8 segundos
Than that which is good. I'll I'll be letting you know if everything goes according to plan probably by Wednesday, but keep me until Friday just to make sure that I have everything ready. But other than that I think I'm doing good progress on that. I did had a had a question for you on valuation.
BT
Brett Tatum
6 minutos 10 segundos6:10
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 10 segundos
Yep.
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 18 segundos
Yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 28 segundos6:28
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 28 segundos
O.
BT
Brett Tatum
6 minutos 28 segundos6:28
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 28 segundos
Mhm.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 29 segundos6:29
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 29 segundos
Go over there quickly, go U on add valuations.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 34 segundos
So over here.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 40 segundos
I was actually thinking about a valuation date for me is going to well for us it should be kind of like the the quarter profit. It's going to be 4 quarters per year. Each quarter you're going to be adding over there kind of like the the profit for.
BT
Brett Tatum
6 minutos 53 segundos6:53
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 53 segundos
Yep.
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 58 segundos
Yeah.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 59 segundos6:59
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 59 segundos
Company for Tatco. In this case, source is going to be manual because we can connect this app later on to quick shares. I forgot the name of the apps you were using, but we can connect it in the future. That's what I'm saying.
BT
Brett Tatum
7 minutos 1 segundo7:01
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 1 segundo
Mhm.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 14 segundos7:14
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 14 segundos
So instead instead of saying manual, we can put another option over there that's going to pull the data automatically just for you to think about if we want to do that in the future too.
BT
Brett Tatum
7 minutos 15 segundos7:15
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 15 segundos
OK, got you.
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 24 segundos
Yeah. So I think there's two, I think there's two things we need here, Mateo. I think the valuation piece of this, the way this form is setting up on this one, I think what we would want to do is we would be adding.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 29 segundos7:29
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 29 segundos
Hmm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 33 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
7 minutos 40 segundos7:40
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 40 segundos
Well, OK, let me back up.
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 44 segundos
The screen that we're looking at here and the way Reigns is set up, this valuation tab is really more for the what they call the stock plans or Reigns shares. So for the profit side, what we really need to capture is a little bit different information and it's not really a valuation what I think.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 54 segundos7:54
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 54 segundos
Hmm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 56 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 2 segundos
OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
8 minutos 4 segundos8:04
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 4 segundos
We need to do is add profit.
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 8 segundos
So you know, I I I think we keep it all in this valuations tab, but as opposed to you have add valuation. I think you have another option here that's add profit. So the way this would work is you'd hit add profit, it'd be the profit date in like this would be the end of the quarter.
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 23 segundos
So I think one thing you also need to be able to select the plan.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 23 segundos8:23
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 23 segundos
Hmm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 28 segundos
Oh, OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
8 minutos 29 segundos8:29
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 29 segundos
So, OK, let's let me think through this here because if we've got a plan, OK, so let's say the tackle Oklahoma City profit sharing plan.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 35 segundos8:35
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 35 segundos
Mm-hmm.
BT
Brett Tatum
8 minutos 37 segundos8:37
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 37 segundos
I need to add a defined profit. So let's say we get to the first quarter, right? We made money. So somewhere I need to go put in that profit so it ties to everyone's plan. So I'm thinking I would do that.
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 53 segundos
Do you think I would do that here or do you think I would do that in the plan?
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 57 segundos8:57
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 57 segundos
Valuations so we don't clutter more functionality on the other side, so it's good. Let's keep it on validations.
BT
Brett Tatum
9 minutos 2 segundos9:02
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 2 segundos
OK. So yeah, so we go here, we go add, add profit. We'd first need to select the plan that it ties to. So you select the plan and then the profit date would be the date at which I define. So in like this case, it's gonna be March 31st.
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 20 segundos
Be the end of our first quarter, Um.
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 25 segundos
We wouldn't have a source.
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 29 segundos
We wouldn't have fair market value, but what we would have is just the the profit. So if we made $200,000 in the quarter, I would just put 200,000 in there. The price per share should automatically calculate based on the number of outstanding shares.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
9 minutos 41 segundos9:41
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 41 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
9 minutos 48 segundos9:48
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 48 segundos
And then the total number of issued shares in the plan. So most of those plans are gonna have 10,000. So the price per share I think should default. The total share should also default from the plan. Does that make sense?
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos10:00
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos
Yes, it does.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos
With us.
BT
Brett Tatum
10 minutos 1 segundo10:01
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 1 segundo
And so then you would hit, you know, add profit and then what I would expect to see here is.
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 9 segundos
You know the the valuation, the the the product kind of details of that that.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 16 segundos10:16
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 16 segundos
Quick question over there, because I see that Reins also does that calculation automatically when you're calculating the price per share. What is that formula? Because I'm actually not familiar on that end.

Brett Tatum
10 minutos 17 segundos10:17
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 17 segundos
Profit issuance, basically, yeah.
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 31 segundos
Yeah, it would. It would just be, well, I don't know. I'd have to look into what it rains is doing exactly, but the formula for us would just be profit divided by outstanding shares.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 42 segundos10:42
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 42 segundos
OK. And that will give you automatically the number of what's for sure. Got it, Yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
10 minutos 46 segundos10:46
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 46 segundos
The price per share number, yes. So you know if like I said all plans, the intent is for them to have 10,000 issued shares. So you would say, let's say we made $200,000 divided by 10,000, which would give you $20 per share.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 54 segundos10:54
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 54 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos
Sounds good in the case that we.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 7 segundos
Go all the way up till 10,000 shares. What should it happen? Like let's say we issue all of the shares available. What would you like the app to do?
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 22 segundos
Nothing for the moment or?
BT
Brett Tatum
11 minutos 22 segundos11:22
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 22 segundos
Well, I think we're talking about, I think we're talking about two different things. So we have the number of shares kind of like in the plan which is 10,000 if throughout all of our stakeholders like adding shares to them if we get to 10,000.
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 38 segundos
That doesn't really change anything in my mind because it's it's still that 10,000 is the total number. So you take a 200,000 / 10,000 and that would give you a price per share and then you would take that price per share and you would multiply it by the number of shares that each stakeholder has.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
11 minutos 41 segundos11:41
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 41 segundos
OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
11 minutos 58 segundos11:58
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 58 segundos
In their plan, their issue number of shares, right?
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos12:00
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos
OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 1 segundo
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 4 segundos
OK, got in.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 7 segundos
OK, good, good to know. So for the moment being, there's not gonna be like too much of A crazy calculation going on over there.
BT
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 10 segundos12:10
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 10 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 14 segundos
Shouldn't be. Should be very simple. And so we don't. There's oh, go ahead.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos 16 segundos12:16
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 16 segundos
Hmm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 19 segundos
And then it.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 21 segundos
No, no, go ahead. My last thing was going to be both settings, so.
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 24 segundos12:24
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 24 segundos
Well, I guess the other, yeah, on the other piece of this valuation when we go add here, I think what we should also pull in too is the milestone for the share.
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 38 segundos
Because that milestone, what we actually when we put in the the the total profit for the quarter, if I'm looking at this screen, I would also like to see what that milestone was.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos 44 segundos12:44
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 44 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 50 segundos
Mm-hmm.
BT
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 50 segundos12:50
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 50 segundos
Is that the milestone is 100,000, so it made 200,000. The milestone was 100,000. The actual price per share is 200,000 -, 100,000 divided by the outstanding shares. Does that make sense?
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 4 segundos13:04
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 4 segundos
OK, yes, it does. Got it. So I'll make sure that every single time we're going to be adding evaluation, it's already tied to the the plan we already built. So if you don't have a plan, you're not gonna be able to add evaluation. And if you add evaluation, it's going to be directly tied to the plan.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 16 segundos13:16
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 16 segundos
Exactly.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 24 segundos13:24
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 24 segundos

BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 24 segundos13:24
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 24 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 26 segundos
Yeah, and here's something else I'm thinking about. I'm just kinda, I can't remember how we set this up.
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 36 segundos
I think we might maybe ought to change this right here. So where we put schedule quarterly, I think what we might ought to do here, this is back in plans is put like scheduled dates for like the payment schedule and actually I have to go in here and like.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 50 segundos13:50
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 50 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 55 segundos13:55
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 55 segundos
Individually select.
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 58 segundos
The actual dates it's gonna pay. So hear me out here. So like if the schedule, if I want to do 4 dates, I'm gonna say I'm gonna do it on 331, so March 31st, I'm gonna do it on June 30th and I'm gonna do it on September 30th and then in December 31st, that's four. That's kind of the typical quarterly payment schedule.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos14:00
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 16 segundos
OK, so in payment.
BT
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 16 segundos14:16
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 16 segundos
'Cause my thought is, oh, go ahead.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 20 segundos14:20
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 20 segundos
Some payment schedule will be pretty much adding an add button at the bottom of that section over there so you can add more dates.
BT
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 25 segundos14:25
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 25 segundos
Yes.
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 27 segundos
Yes, yeah. So supposed to schedule and saying quarterly, we would just say, you know, add, add date, add date, add date.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda

Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 34 segundos
Gotcha.
BT
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 35 segundos14:35
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 35 segundos
Because my thought is, is then when we're coming over here to valuations, sorry, get out of this. Yeah, Dang it. Sorry, hold on when I come to valuations.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 41 segundos14:41
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 41 segundos
What?
BT
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 48 segundos14:48
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 48 segundos
Add a profit as opposed to valuation date. Same thing valuation or the profit date I can select after I take the plan, it'll give me the options of selecting one of the dates that I already pre put into the plan. That way I can keep everything tied together.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
15 minutos 7 segundos15:07
Mateo Roldan Taborda 15 minutos 7 segundos
OK, it does. So yeah, it's going to be more organized. I like it.
BT
Brett Tatum
15 minutos 8 segundos15:08
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 8 segundos
Does that make sense?
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 10 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 13 segundos
And then, yeah, then we can tie all that back to the.
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 18 segundos
Stakeholders and their their shares that have been issued. Yeah, I think that makes.
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 25 segundos
I think that'll make sense. Um, so that way I can't pick a a random, you know, a date that's off doesn't align with the plan.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
15 minutos 33 segundos15:33
Mateo Roldan Taborda 15 minutos 33 segundos
It's true. It's gonna force you to actually be aligned to what you said previously. So it's good. Yeah, I like it.
