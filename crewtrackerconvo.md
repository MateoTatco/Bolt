Got it.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
0 minutos 13 segundos0:13
Mateo Roldan Taborda 0 minutos 13 segundos
Awesome. So most of the changes that you and Harrison actually requested are completely done now, so I'll go through them fairly quickly and then if you do have any questions, you'll be able to let me know. So now we kind of like for employees and jobs, you'll have the export function ready.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 0 minutos 33 segundos
You'll be able to see all of the details attached from the schedule directly from employees and jobs as well for the future, whenever in the message history you want to go to.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 0 minutos 49 segundos
Anyone personal messages that have been sent either from you or from them, you'll be able to search them on their employee detail page right over here as well. So it's just a neat feature for you. Same thing with jobs, I exported everything from.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 8 segundos
From what you guys gave me last week and with a few neat features over here, right? If you select multiple of them, you'll be able to change the status of it fairly quickly as well. You can either delete them.
BT

Brett Tatum
1 minuto 23 segundos1:23
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 23 segundos
Can I? Can I pause it? Can I pause you right down the table? Harrison, do you want to be changing the status of the project here in Bolt or do you want to let that automatically change as you guys push over projects, upload projects from the red team export?

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 25 segundos1:25
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 25 segundos
Yep.
HM

Harrison McKee
1 minuto 41 segundos1:41
Harrison McKee 1 minuto 41 segundos
I think it would help to do it kind of automatically. My other my other deal was like I don't feel like we need to have that many different options in bolt.
Harrison McKee 1 minuto 52 segundos
Like I understand why we have in proposal this, that or the other. But like we need to think about this bulk crew tracker as guys either are going to the job or they're not. It's either active or it's not. It doesn't matter what draft inactive like.
BT

Brett Tatum
2 minutos 1 segundo2:01
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 1 segundo
Good.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
2 minutos 8 segundos2:08
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 8 segundos
Request for out there.
HM

Harrison McKee
2 minutos 9 segundos2:09
Harrison McKee 2 minutos 9 segundos
To me, it's like I feel like it should just.
Harrison McKee 2 minutos 13 segundos
If guys don't go to that job in, you know, 30 days, it automatically goes inactive or whatever the heck, and then you just bring it back to life.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
2 minutos 22 segundos2:22
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 22 segundos
Sounds good. I'll change. I'll roll it back to what it was before because that's the original one. I just added more because I saw that in the sheet you have multiple statuses over there.
HM

Harrison McKee
2 minutos 30 segundos2:30
Harrison McKee 2 minutos 30 segundos
Yeah, that that is how our like accounting software works is they have all the different proposal in progress, request, draft. But I I I don't think from the crew tracker point you need five or six options. Either the guys are going there or they're not.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
2 minutos 36 segundos2:36
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 36 segundos
Uh.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 38 segundos
I see.
BT

Brett Tatum
2 minutos 38 segundos2:38
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 38 segundos
Yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
2 minutos 46 segundos2:46
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 46 segundos
OK, sounds good. Then I'll roll it back.
Brett Tatum
2 minutos 48 segundos2:48
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 48 segundos
No.
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 49 segundos
Harrison, just just to think about this though, 'cause I'm.
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 54 segundos
Periodically, someone in your office will be uploading the job Excel sheet. So you'll do the export and you'll upload it.
HM
Harrison McKee
3 minutos 3 segundos3:03
Harrison McKee 3 minutos 3 segundos
Yep.
BT
Brett Tatum
3 minutos 4 segundos3:04
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 4 segundos
That export won't replace any job that's already in there, 'cause we don't wanna do an override, right?
HM
Harrison McKee
3 minutos 12 segundos3:12
Harrison McKee 3 minutos 12 segundos
Yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
3 minutos 14 segundos3:14
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 14 segundos
And then the question is, is like do we want status just to be completely ignored in that upload or do you want that upload to trigger whether it's active or inactive? And then you can also just change it from the the bolt screen.
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 30 segundos
I'm trying to figure out how we wanted to interact with the export or the import. Does that make sense?
HM
Harrison McKee
3 minutos 34 segundos3:34
Harrison McKee 3 minutos 34 segundos
I would only want to export projects that are in proposal or in progress.
BT
Brett Tatum
3 minutos 43 segundos3:43
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 43 segundos
OK, so I'm sorry. OK, so out of you're just gonna tell your team then like, hey, only export this type of project.
HM
Harrison McKee
3 minutos 49 segundos3:49
Harrison McKee 3 minutos 49 segundos
Only export active files. If we get a messed up one in there, then so be it. We'll back it out.
BT
Brett Tatum
3 minutos 55 segundos3:55
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 55 segundos
Just change it. Yeah, OK.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 57 segundos3:57
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 57 segundos
Sounds good. Then on that note, any jobs you import into the system that are are ready here will be completely ignored. You will only be able to add new ones like you requested last time. So for example, if you have just 74 jobs and you imported, you have the 73 jobs over here.
HM
Harrison McKee
4 minutos 10 segundos4:10
Harrison McKee 4 minutos 10 segundos
Death.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
4 minutos 17 segundos4:17
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 17 segundos
Here you import a new sheet with 75. The 73 that you already imported are not gonna be reimported here into the system, only the two, the two more. So that way you don't have to figure out which ones are here or not already the system.
HM
Harrison McKee
4 minutos 24 segundos4:24
Harrison McKee 4 minutos 24 segundos
Correct.
Harrison McKee 4 minutos 29 segundos
And the way it tells it, the way it tells which job is the project number, right? It's not the name, it's not the address, it's nothing else. It's just the project number. OK.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
4 minutos 38 segundos4:38
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 38 segundos
Yeah, over here you can search them however you want. If you want to search one for project number, you can do it. If you want to search it by address, you can do it as well. Like the system is intelligent enough to figure out which one you are trying to search.
HM
Harrison McKee
4 minutos 51 segundos4:51
Harrison McKee 4 minutos 51 segundos
OK.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
4 minutos 52 segundos4:52
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 52 segundos
So it's going to be easy for you. I don't know if you saw what saw it, but like this is automatically as well like the address, the work location like as soon as you put it over here like it will immediately take you to the Google, Google page of it. So it's good. If you need it with Apple Maps or anything like that, let me know. But for the moment Google I believe is going to suffice.
BT
Brett Tatum
5 minutos 1 segundo5:01
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 1 segundo
Nice.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
5 minutos 13 segundos5:13
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 13 segundos
Then the same over here for um.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 18 segundos
The updates you wanted filters for whenever these became big enough you have. You can either search in the notes for the updates from dates or to whoever you created because this is going to be picking up who is editing the job.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 37 segundos
This synced by the user, right? So you have more than enough freedom to search through updates in the future and as well as activity timeline over here. And as well you have the export to Excel in case you need something more detailed for one single job, right? It's going to tie through the messages.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 57 segundos
through the schedule and through the people who have worked here as well. So you'll have a very detailed export into a job.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 7 segundos
Now next the scheduler. Let me show you one where I had a little bit more options. So now you requested that in the columns add a task and everything here to the right whenever you want something.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 27 segundos
Into these ones you'll get something called an exception. So for example over here new task right new task. Now it will appear over here on the exception row and you have a few options you can either.
Harrison McKee
6 minutos 37 segundos6:37
Harrison McKee 6 minutos 37 segundos
Yep.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 47 segundos6:47
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 47 segundos
For you to be able to acknowledge it, you can either market review or clear note. If you just want to know where it is, you just click on it and you'll have visual notes over here so your team knows. Sorry, so your.
HM
Harrison McKee
6 minutos 59 segundos6:59
Harrison McKee 6 minutos 59 segundos
Will that hold? Will that hold if you don't look at this for over the weekend or you know what I'm saying? If you're not on the same calendar day, will it hold indefinite?

Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 6 segundos7:06
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 6 segundos
Yep.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 8 segundos
Yeah, until you acknowledge it. So you'll have well for the very first is whenever you click on it, you'll have kind of like the the blue blinking effect over here. But these ones over here, kind of like the the the blue blinking with the little dot onto the top right corner, won't go away until you click.
HM
Harrison McKee
7 minutos 9 segundos7:09
Harrison McKee 7 minutos 9 segundos
OK.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 28 segundos7:28
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 28 segundos
Click it. Once you click it, it means you acknowledge it. And once you acknowledge it, it means that whoever is reading these is actually needs to pay attention to it, right? So you can do whatever the task is or acknowledge whatever the note is. Same thing with this one and whenever you're ready, just mark review.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 48 segundos
And then it will go away until you make further changes into that row.
BT
Brett Tatum
7 minutos 53 segundos7:53
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 53 segundos
Harrison, do you like, do you like that feature of just like the simple click? I'm afraid that that's gonna start like someone's gonna mistakenly click on something who's not really the one responsible.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 1 segundo8:01
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 1 segundo
Unless unless you click on marked over here, it will still appear as after you go back over here.
HM
Harrison McKee
8 minutos 3 segundos8:03
Harrison McKee 8 minutos 3 segundos
It I feel like.
Harrison McKee 8 minutos 9 segundos
I feel like in time that'll be an issue. Brett, like I'm with you. As of right now, I don't. I think like Jamie would yell through the wall. Oh, sorry, I messed that up. You know what I mean? But I'm with you. Like, I think there needs to be some level of.
BT
Brett Tatum
8 minutos 13 segundos8:13
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 13 segundos
Yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 14 segundos8:14
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 14 segundos
OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
8 minutos 20 segundos8:20
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 20 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 26 segundos
I guess my my thought.
HM
Harrison McKee
8 minutos 27 segundos8:27
Harrison McKee 8 minutos 27 segundos
Or if there's like a if there's like a history of what you've reviewed, so you could at least go get it.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 33 segundos8:33
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 33 segundos
Hmm.
BT
Brett Tatum
8 minutos 35 segundos8:35
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 35 segundos
Yeah, so that's that's what's gonna be my suggestion is maybe there's not a a functionality on this view that allows you to remove like kind of do the click thing. You have to actually go to exceptions and once you click on exceptions 'cause that has a little, I mean you mark is reviewed.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 36 segundos8:36
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 36 segundos
Yes.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 52 segundos
The thing is, unless you click on review, the little dots over here on the blinking effect won't go away. So for example if you like, it doesn't matter if one day passes or two weeks passes or even a year.
BT
Brett Tatum
9 minutos9:00
Brett Tatum 9 minutos
Oh, OK.
HM
Harrison McKee
9 minutos 4 segundos9:04
Harrison McKee 9 minutos 4 segundos
Yeah, but if you go and you click on that box, what happens? No, go back to schedule.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
9 minutos 8 segundos9:08
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 8 segundos
On Mark.
BT
Brett Tatum
9 minutos 8 segundos9:08
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 8 segundos
Yeah, I thought you'd just go back to schedule.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
9 minutos 12 segundos9:12
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 12 segundos
It goes over here, right? Like unclick it. But then as soon you change the the date, right? You go back to exceptions, you see these again. Hey look, it's here again. It goes away if you click it on the moment.
BT
Brett Tatum
9 minutos 13 segundos9:13
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 13 segundos
Yeah, so you click on that.
HM
Harrison McKee
9 minutos 14 segundos9:14
Harrison McKee 9 minutos 14 segundos
Yep.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
9 minutos 28 segundos9:28
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 28 segundos
But the exceptions notification won't ever go away unless you click on mark review or clear note, right? Which honestly I'm just gonna change it to mark review because clear note and mark review do exactly the same thing but.
HM
Harrison McKee
9 minutos 29 segundos9:29
Harrison McKee 9 minutos 29 segundos
I got you.
Harrison McKee 9 minutos 35 segundos
I got you. That's fine.
BT
Brett Tatum
9 minutos 41 segundos9:41
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 41 segundos
Yeah, yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
9 minutos 43 segundos9:43
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 43 segundos
But like this won't go away. It won't stop bugging you until you click on mark review. That's kind of like the the the the full proof that I kind of like could imagine.
HM
Harrison McKee
9 minutos 54 segundos9:54
Harrison McKee 9 minutos 54 segundos
It.
BT
Brett Tatum
9 minutos 56 segundos9:56
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 56 segundos
I think that works.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
9 minutos 59 segundos9:59
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 59 segundos
Mm-hmm.
HM
Harrison McKee
10 minutos10:00
Harrison McKee 10 minutos
Note like delete everything in the note box.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 3 segundos10:03
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 3 segundos
Just for like the the row that you selected, not everything. So for example if you have multiple of them you will only mark review the the row, the specific row.
Harrison McKee
10 minutos 15 segundos10:15
Harrison McKee 10 minutos 15 segundos
But that clear note in red next to it that basically deletes all the contents in that box is how it did it on Friday when I was playing with it.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 19 segundos10:19
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 19 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 23 segundos
Oh, I'll I'll I'll remove clear note because yeah, I only I only just need mark review for you guys because I only want these ones to to be marked and acknowledged on your end.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 40 segundos
Make sense?
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 42 segundos
Or is this something that we maybe wanna change a little bit?
BT
Brett Tatum
10 minutos 48 segundos10:48
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 48 segundos
Harrison infer to you on that if you wanted.
HM
Harrison McKee
10 minutos 51 segundos10:51
Harrison McKee 10 minutos 51 segundos
I mean the only thing that I could see being useful is like almost like a little.
Harrison McKee 11 minutos 2 segundos
Because everybody's bolt's unique to them, right? Whether it's a unique like history of what you've done or whether it's like under that exceptions tab, if you could see like this was cleared by Sam, this was cleared by Jamie, this was cleared by Harrison.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
11 minutos 6 segundos11:06
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 6 segundos
Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 14 segundos
Huh.
BT
Brett Tatum
11 minutos 17 segundos11:17
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 17 segundos
Yeah, that that's what I was thinking. So like if you go back into your exception, yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
11 minutos 20 segundos11:20
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 20 segundos
OK.
HM
Harrison McKee
11 minutos 20 segundos11:20
Harrison McKee 11 minutos 20 segundos
And just giving me like a little running tab that you could scroll through. I don't need an in-depth search box. I don't need anything crazy crazy. I just need enough to know that if I accidentally click something and say Jamie, it's in the folder, you might have to Scroll down, but it's in there.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
11 minutos 35 segundos11:35
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 35 segundos
Sounds good. Yeah, an activity notepad for you to be able to kind of like trace your steps. Yeah, I can definitely add that for you fairly quickly as well. We already created one for employees and jobs, so I'll create one for schedule as well. So maybe that's helpful as well. So on that note, I'll again.
BT
Brett Tatum
11 minutos 47 segundos11:47
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 47 segundos
No.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
11 minutos 53 segundos11:53
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 53 segundos
Remove clear note just to make sure that I'm not deleting for you guys not to make a mistake over here and to make sure that you have like everything you need just for the for the notes right now. Another cool feature as requested by you guys as well the columns you can select whatever you want to see on your screen.
BT
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 13 segundos12:13
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 13 segundos
So.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos 13 segundos12:13
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 13 segundos
And it will be saved across your entire user base. Not user base, sorry for your own account. So whenever you reload right like the system is intelligent enough to remember which columns you want to see.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 28 segundos
Right. Even after you log out of the app, you will only be seeing the ones that you actually toggle on and off, right? So it's fairly simple. You'll be able to see them over here. Again, you can just select whatever date and it's good. Another feature.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 46 segundos
So for example, you have the same job for two people. Now onto the right you have the unmerge option over here. So as requested, maybe there are 10 people going to the same job location, but you need one of them to be a little bit different. So you just click over here on merge and.
Harrison McKee
12 minutos 53 segundos12:53
Harrison McKee 12 minutos 53 segundos
Stop.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 6 segundos13:06
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 6 segundos
And you'll have same jobs but different roles as requested.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 9 segundos13:09
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 9 segundos
But OK, so can you show me how this works, Mateo, when you have put all three guys on the job?

Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 14 segundos13:14
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 14 segundos
Yeah, of course. So Chase, let me, let me go for a different date. So over here, Chase, Jamie and me, right. All of them in the same job, right?
HM
Harrison McKee
13 minutos 18 segundos13:18
Harrison McKee 13 minutos 18 segundos
Yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 24 segundos13:24
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 24 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 25 segundos
Yep, Yep, all in the same job.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 27 segundos13:27
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 27 segundos
All on the same job. So right now it's merged the three of them.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 30 segundos13:30
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 30 segundos
OK, now now what happens when you unmerge?

Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 34 segundos13:34
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 34 segundos
Just one of them. Yeah, just click on the actions over here and the little arrow here and then it just deselects this one over here.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 37 segundos13:37
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 37 segundos
Oh, OK, good pulls up.
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 42 segundos
OK, now what happens when you add like a four? Like if you were to add a fourth member, where does it try to merge?
HM
Harrison McKee
13 minutos 49 segundos13:49
Harrison McKee 13 minutos 49 segundos
Jumps up with a merged group.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 50 segundos13:50
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 50 segundos
To the first one.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 52 segundos
To the first one, it recognizes the unmerged 1.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 53 segundos13:53
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 53 segundos
You.
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 58 segundos
You you tell me the functionality there. Harrison, that feels a little bit tough because I'm thinking you're gonna have some big jobs. You're gonna send three guys to go do this this framing and you're send three guys to go do this sheet rock work is is that merging and.
HM
Harrison McKee
14 minutos 12 segundos14:12
Harrison McKee 14 minutos 12 segundos
I think that's fine because I don't. I don't normally split. I don't normally split it up like that. Like I won't normally do what you're talking about in the notes section. 9 times out of 10, the one that I need to separate out would just be the crew lead to get some sort of specialty notes like.
BT
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 19 segundos14:19
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 19 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 28 segundos
Fade and cinema materials.
HM
Harrison McKee
14 minutos 32 segundos14:32
Harrison McKee 14 minutos 32 segundos
Maybe I put that on the crew leads notes. I'm sending you a total of eight guys. You just put 3 on framing.
BT
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 38 segundos14:38
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 38 segundos
Fair enough.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 39 segundos14:39
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 39 segundos
If that works for you, I'm hay to leave the future as it is.
HM
Harrison McKee
14 minutos 43 segundos14:43
Harrison McKee 14 minutos 43 segundos
Because I also don't want to have there. There's a little bit of this where we played around with with the crew and I feel like you don't want to have just a day labor kind of dictating their roles in the day. Like, well, I'm here to frame. Well, you suck at framing. Harrison didn't know that when he scheduled you, you're going to do drywall.
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 55 segundos14:55
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 55 segundos
Sure.
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 57 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 15 minutos
Yeah, fair enough. Yeah, you do give that flexibility to the crew lead. I like that. OK, I just wanted to make sure that I was curious how when you started to get to multiple guides and you had multiple tasks. So if you're just gonna use the notes, then all the better.
HM
Harrison McKee
15 minutos 9 segundos15:09
Harrison McKee 15 minutos 9 segundos
Yeah.
Harrison McKee 15 minutos 11 segundos
Two other things I was playing with where it says save schedule. Is there a way to not have to like click it? Because I know like if you jump around on dates right now and try to come back to this, you'll lose it.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
15 minutos 15 segundos15:15
Mateo Roldan Taborda 15 minutos 15 segundos
Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 15 minutos 25 segundos
Yeah, yeah, of course. The save schedule is just kind of like the the started feature for for us to kind of like see how everything works. Now as soon as we're happy, I'll change this to an automatic save schedule. As soon as you notice a change here, we'll automatically save. It's just kind of that's a.
HM
Harrison McKee
15 minutos 38 segundos15:38
Harrison McKee 15 minutos 38 segundos
Yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
15 minutos 43 segundos15:43
Mateo Roldan Taborda 15 minutos 43 segundos
Kind of like an ending feature because it does take few resources from bolt to kind of like have that active all the time. So I'd rather put it once we're happy with all of the changes on the schedule.
HM
Harrison McKee
15 minutos 54 segundos15:54
Harrison McKee 15 minutos 54 segundos
OK. And then uh, secondly to get that exceptions.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
16 minutos 1 segundo16:01
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 1 segundo
Mhm.

Harrison McKee
16 minutos 1 segundo16:01

Mateo Roldan Taborda

Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 4 segundos
Yes.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 8 segundos
Everything from added tasks all the way to materials needed.
HM
Harrison McKee
16 minutos 13 segundos16:13
Harrison McKee 16 minutos 13 segundos
The only thing we needed to do is the added tasks or tasks not completed slash need more time.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
16 minutos 18 segundos16:18
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 18 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 22 segundos

Yeah, I could. I could argue notes too. Materials needed. I definitely don't want an exception for because that's going to get used almost daily and it's going to get plugged in from our PM team and I don't want just another flag popping up.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
16 minutos 27 segundos16:27
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 27 segundos
Sounds good.
BT
Brett Tatum
16 minutos 36 segundos16:36
Brett Tatum 16 minutos 36 segundos
Sure.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
16 minutos 36 segundos16:36
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 36 segundos
OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 41 segundos
So good. So just these three.
HM
Harrison McKee
16 minutos 44 segundos16:44
Harrison McKee 16 minutos 44 segundos
Yes, basically, Yep. Those are where the crew is gonna talk back to the PM department.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
16 minutos 46 segundos16:46
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 46 segundos
Other tasks.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 49 segundos
Sounds good. So add the tasks, notes and tasks not completed. Need more time.
HM
Harrison McKee
16 minutos 54 segundos16:54
Harrison McKee 16 minutos 54 segundos
Yes, materials needed. We don't need on there for the exceptions. The save was another one I had and then lastly if you scroll over to the employees.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
17 minutos 6 segundos17:06
Mateo Roldan Taborda 17 minutos 6 segundos
Mhm.

Harrison McKee
17 minutos 7 segundos17:07
Harrison McKee 17 minutos 7 segundos
If you wanted to take Jamie's name away for a minute.
Harrison McKee 17 minutos 13 segundos
Like just take his name off, go back to where it's just blank to where I'm saying Brett, you could assign somebody. It's not an option to do currently.
BT
Brett Tatum
17 minutos 20 segundos17:20
Brett Tatum 17 minutos 20 segundos
Sure, it's just an empty but.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
17 minutos 20 segundos17:20
Mateo Roldan Taborda 17 minutos 20 segundos
Oh.
BT
Brett Tatum
17 minutos 23 segundos17:23
Brett Tatum 17 minutos 23 segundos
OK.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
17 minutos 23 segundos17:23
Mateo Roldan Taborda 17 minutos 23 segundos
Yeah, that's true. Good eye. So I'll change that.
HM
Harrison McKee
17 minutos 26 segundos17:26
Harrison McKee 17 minutos 26 segundos
You've gotta. You've gotta pick somebody else's name. I need to be able to set it blank for on the off chance that somebody else has to jump in.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
17 minutos 29 segundos17:29
Mateo Roldan Taborda 17 minutos 29 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
17 minutos 36 segundos17:36
Brett Tatum 17 minutos 36 segundos
Kind of on that on that same token, it it Harrison, I would feel like you would never want to put one employee on 2 lines. Is that true? Like what you mean?

Mateo Roldan Taborda
17 minutos 37 segundos17:37
Mateo Roldan Taborda 17 minutos 37 segundos
Sounds good.
HM
Harrison McKee
17 minutos 47 segundos17:47
Harrison McKee 17 minutos 47 segundos
That's not not not entirely true. Like sometimes I'll split time. Hey, go, Jamie, go to Brett's office, **** the door, and then go over here. So we'll split his hours up. But I mean, I guess you could ultimately do that in the notes section too.
BT
Brett Tatum
17 minutos 53 segundos17:53
Brett Tatum 17 minutos 53 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 18 minutos 5 segundos
Well, it's up to you because my thought was is you're gonna have 30 to 40 guys in this list. That becomes a lot to remember for like a Camila. She's putting him in like, oh, did I already put that guy in, especially when they're all named Jose? Does it help if once you've selected them, they're no longer in your drop down list?
HM
Harrison McKee
18 minutos 18 segundos18:18
Harrison McKee 18 minutos 18 segundos
Yeah.
Harrison McKee 18 minutos 24 segundos
Yeah, yeah, I think that helps. That would help because then it automatically goes away and then we could just force them to do it in the notes if we had to do it, which is fine.
BT
Brett Tatum
18 minutos 35 segundos18:35
Brett Tatum 18 minutos 35 segundos
Yeah, and then.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
18 minutos 36 segundos18:36
Mateo Roldan Taborda 18 minutos 36 segundos
Sounds good. So two things I can actually add over here. So remove once in the employee column. Once you select someone, it completely goes away like you cannot put up unto the employee for that day again, right? And.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 18 minutos 51 segundos
Maybe on the notes, kind of like a tagging feature. Kind of like in teams whenever you need to bring the attention for someone in a chat. Kind of like when whenever you do the add, I don't know Brett and then it will ping them directly, right? It'll kind of create a.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 19 minutos 7 segundos
Like the the employee over there again so you can add them on the notes too. Make sense.
Harrison McKee
19 minutos 13 segundos19:13
Harrison McKee 19 minutos 13 segundos
Yeah, here, here's part of that that I've got a question with. So let's say Mateo, can you click off of where you're at real quick just so I can see the list?
Harrison McKee 19 minutos 23 segundos
OK, let so the employee #3, right? Let's say we were waiting to decide who that third one's gonna be. Similar to the upload feature. Is it a way where I could say, OK, well, I know I'm gonna plug in another name I'm waiting on.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
19 minutos 33 segundos19:33
Mateo Roldan Taborda 19 minutos 33 segundos
Mhm.
HM
Harrison McKee
19 minutos 41 segundos19:41
Harrison McKee 19 minutos 41 segundos
Camilla to get back with me on who that'll be. Could I go ahead and update? Like could I go ahead and send the SMS to everybody on this? And then whenever I reupdate that fourth one, I hit send SMS and it won't duplicate send or not.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
19 minutos 43 segundos19:43
Mateo Roldan Taborda 19 minutos 43 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 19 minutos 49 segundos
Yep.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 19 minutos 56 segundos
Hmm, interesting. I haven't built that, but we can't.
HM
Harrison McKee
19 minutos 57 segundos19:57
Harrison McKee 19 minutos 57 segundos
Or is it gonna send everybody, all 30 guys the same text again?

Mateo Roldan Taborda
20 minutos 2 segundos20:02
Mateo Roldan Taborda 20 minutos 2 segundos
At the moment you will so, but I haven't thought of that. So like maybe if you already sent an SMS for today to everybody and then you wanna send again to the ones that you haven't yet, I can create the validation so that we only send one.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 20 minutos 18 segundos
Instead of thousand over and over again. Make sense.
HM
Harrison McKee
20 minutos 23 segundos20:23
Harrison McKee 20 minutos 23 segundos
Because I know that a lot of times they'll be and why why this comes up is we might have the 30 man roster filled out and at 8:00 at night get a change and we just need to change around three or four people. I want to be able to change that in here and then hit send again.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
20 minutos 32 segundos20:32
Mateo Roldan Taborda 20 minutos 32 segundos
No.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 20 minutos 35 segundos
Hmm.
HM
Harrison McKee
20 minutos 39 segundos20:39
Harrison McKee 20 minutos 39 segundos
Only text the people that the information changed, not the full list of everybody.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
20 minutos 44 segundos20:44
Mateo Roldan Taborda 20 minutos 44 segundos
Sounds good. Yeah, I'll create that validation. At the moment I didn't even thought about that, so it's good that you told me. So I'll create moving forward. I'll create that function. If you already sent text messages to everybody here, you'll be able to to send the text message just to the ones.
BT
Brett Tatum
20 minutos 53 segundos20:53
Brett Tatum 20 minutos 53 segundos
No.
Brett Tatum 20 minutos 58 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 21 minutos
Let think through this with me a second. Harrison and Mateo too so.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
21 minutos 1 segundo21:01
Mateo Roldan Taborda 21 minutos 1 segundo
Hmm.
BT
Brett Tatum
21 minutos 6 segundos21:06
Brett Tatum 21 minutos 6 segundos
I I feel like we're gonna have maybe some complications down the road where like our notification platform and the schedule are the same thing. I guess my question is is should we have another item at the top which is ribbon which is like notification?
Brett Tatum 21 minutos 24 segundos
And in this case like you you build out same format.
Brett Tatum 21 minutos 30 segundos
But this is just purely for putting in the guys that you want to notify. And then the schedule is a second tab that you would go into like once. So let's say you sent this notification to these three guys that you have listed here. It kind of moves over and starts to create a daily schedule.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
21 minutos 45 segundos21:45
Mateo Roldan Taborda 21 minutos 45 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
21 minutos 49 segundos21:49
Brett Tatum 21 minutos 49 segundos
And that is where you're editing notes, tasks, stuff like that.
Brett Tatum 21 minutos 54 segundos
Then if you have to go back and you're like, oh shoot, I need to change this guy. Well, you come back to your notification tab, you put him in and it then kind of pushes over to the schedule and overrides what he was originally scheduled for. Does that kind of make sense? Like do we need to be operating out of two different?
Brett Tatum 22 minutos 11 segundos
Forms one to notify and then one that actually builds the schedule for that day that then you guys can go in and edit, add notes, take away stuff.
HM
Harrison McKee
22 minutos 21 segundos22:21
Harrison McKee 22 minutos 21 segundos
I think that this, I mean, I think they really are kind of one and the same.
BT
Brett Tatum
22 minutos 26 segundos22:26
Brett Tatum 22 minutos 26 segundos
What I worry about though, is this when you need to make changes and how that's gonna affect the downstream piece. I almost feel like you have. We're trying to do 2 things in the same form, which is 1 notify the employees, but two create a interactive form that allows for updates.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
22 minutos 26 segundos22:26
Mateo Roldan Taborda 22 minutos 26 segundos
M.
BT
Brett Tatum
22 minutos 43 segundos22:43
Brett Tatum 22 minutos 43 segundos
Once the schedule's been created.
HM
Harrison McKee
22 minutos 49 segundos22:49
Harrison McKee 22 minutos 49 segundos
Oh.
Harrison McKee 22 minutos 51 segundos
The only thing I could say if you wanted to do it that way is like you can create an update tab and you can take out added task notes or tasks to be completed. But I think everything else like I think you. I think one needs to be this one needs to be ran and pushed hard from the PM seat.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
22 minutos 51 segundos22:51
Mateo Roldan Taborda 22 minutos 51 segundos
Well.
BT
Brett Tatum
23 minutos23:00
Brett Tatum 23 minutos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 23 minutos 10 segundos
Yep.
HM
Harrison McKee
23 minutos 11 segundos23:11
Harrison McKee 23 minutos 11 segundos
And I think there needs to be a way for the crew to get responses or stuff back up to the PM.
Harrison McKee 23 minutos 21 segundos
Right now, that's by Camilla floating through here, typing on notes, anything and everything that changed. If it's something more in depth than a note, you might say, you know, we've installed doors. I also sent an e-mail. Check your e-mail.
BT
Brett Tatum
23 minutos 34 segundos23:34
Brett Tatum 23 minutos 34 segundos
Yeah, what do you think about that, Mateo? Just from a trying to preserve data and keep things clean, does it make sense to split up?
Brett Tatum 23 minutos 46 segundos
Those two, so it's like.
Brett Tatum 23 minutos 49 segundos
Your notification create the schedule.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
23 minutos 49 segundos23:49
Mateo Roldan Taborda 23 minutos 49 segundos
It does. It does make sense to kind of like split up both of them.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 23 minutos 58 segundos
But at the end of the day, it's going to depend on on you guys because I I guess that will create another additional step for whoever is going to be reviewing these on a day-to-day basis. So my job here, my job here is to make sure that the system is simple enough.
Harrison McKee
24 minutos 8 segundos24:08
Harrison McKee 24 minutos 8 segundos
That that's my dog.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
24 minutos 15 segundos24:15
Mateo Roldan Taborda 24 minutos 15 segundos
For you guys, but if this is a necessary step, I'm happy to build it for you guys as well. Like this is going to be. I want to make something that is easy to use for you guys, so if this is needed I'm happy to go for it.
BT
Brett Tatum
24 minutos 29 segundos24:29
Brett Tatum 24 minutos 29 segundos
If it's not needed, sorry, this is just something I was kind of thinking of as you were talking about like, oh man, I might send these ten guys 'cause I know where they're going, but I might need 10 more. You know, I'm not finished with the rest of the day. That was kind of my thought.
HM
Harrison McKee
24 minutos 30 segundos24:30
Harrison McKee 24 minutos 30 segundos
I've.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
24 minutos 41 segundos24:41
Mateo Roldan Taborda 24 minutos 41 segundos
Yeah.
HM
Harrison McKee
24 minutos 42 segundos24:42
Harrison McKee 24 minutos 42 segundos
I I don't think it's necessarily needed. Right now Jamie has three schedules going. He's got an Excel platform, then he's or two Excels. One's like just a day counter. It looks like a traditional calendar and he puts the number of guys by where they're going.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
24 minutos 42 segundos24:42
Mateo Roldan Taborda 24 minutos 42 segundos
Another thing that I can actually add over here, sorry.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 24 minutos 48 segundos
Mhm.
HM
Harrison McKee
24 minutos 57 segundos24:57
Harrison McKee 24 minutos 57 segundos
And then he runs this in Excel and then Mattea and then Camilla grabs all of it out and sends it in text. Like I feel like the whole ease of this is to put it on one sheet and create more of like the master playbook that everybody pulls from.
Harrison McKee 25 minutos 13 segundos
Because it creates less confusion of oh, I missed it on that sheet or I missed it on this sheet. If you're touching the schedule, you've got all the information you need.
BT
Brett Tatum
25 minutos 22 segundos25:22
Brett Tatum 25 minutos 22 segundos
OK, well, let's not make it. Let's not make that change. We always change if we realize we've created some sort of problem down the road.
HM
Harrison McKee
25 minutos 27 segundos25:27
Harrison McKee 25 minutos 27 segundos
Yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
25 minutos 29 segundos25:29
Mateo Roldan Taborda 25 minutos 29 segundos
Yep, then something that I can actually add over here, probably maybe for the ease of mind of everybody here. It's just an additional column over here with an option to select a row. And with the rows you can just customize information based on that easier. For example, if you only wanna send one message and you have the whole thing filled up, just select the row and.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 25 minutos 48 segundos
Send SMS.
Harrison McKee
25 minutos 51 segundos25:51
Harrison McKee 25 minutos 51 segundos
OK.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
25 minutos 51 segundos25:51
Mateo Roldan Taborda 25 minutos 51 segundos
Yeah, sounds good. Another another need. Mm-hmm. Go ahead.
HM
Harrison McKee
25 minutos 53 segundos25:53
Harrison McKee 25 minutos 53 segundos
Uh.
BT
Brett Tatum
25 minutos 53 segundos25:53
Brett Tatum 25 minutos 53 segundos
One other oh, go ahead. Well, I was gonna say that one other thing on here that I feel like we might need from kind of like a data validation standpoint. So Harrison, you'll you guys, you know when someone's gonna be off next week or they're not gonna be able to, do you want to put that be able to put that in advance like as soon as you know?
Brett Tatum 26 minutos 13 segundos
Do you want to be able to go into that employee and like have black block dates? So that way when you come in and you select, let's just say on 2/18 Jamie was supposed to be out of the office. Well, I would assume when you try to go put Jamie in the schedule, you want to just not see him or or he's.
HM
Harrison McKee
26 minutos 16 segundos26:16
Harrison McKee 26 minutos 16 segundos
Block dates.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
26 minutos 20 segundos26:20
Mateo Roldan Taborda 26 minutos 20 segundos
Hmm.
HM
Harrison McKee
26 minutos 31 segundos26:31
Harrison McKee 26 minutos 31 segundos
Or make him turn red to where it like will let you. You click it and it like kind of double highlights like off work or something.
BT
Brett Tatum
26 minutos 38 segundos26:38
Brett Tatum 26 minutos 38 segundos
Yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
26 minutos 38 segundos26:38
Mateo Roldan Taborda 26 minutos 38 segundos
OK, sounds good. I can add over here for example just another status saying time off with a time range.
HM
Harrison McKee
26 minutos 43 segundos26:43
Harrison McKee 26 minutos 43 segundos
Good.
Harrison McKee 26 minutos 46 segundos
Yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
26 minutos 47 segundos26:47
Brett Tatum 26 minutos 47 segundos
Yeah, it just, you know, we they need to be able to continue to add kind of like blackout dates if you will. And I like Harrison's idea. Don't eliminate them from the employee drop down, just see if they can turn red or something.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
26 minutos 52 segundos26:52
Mateo Roldan Taborda 26 minutos 52 segundos
Yeah.
HM
Harrison McKee
26 minutos 57 segundos26:57
Harrison McKee 26 minutos 57 segundos
List.
Harrison McKee 27 minutos 1 segundo
Yeah, I don't want them to go inactive. I don't want them. If they're just out for a dentist appointment, just make them turn their name red and don't necessarily allow me to click them, but allow them to kind of hover in the off status or make them auto populate at the bottom of the list.
Harrison McKee 27 minutos 18 segundos
And read off.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
27 minutos 19 segundos27:19
Mateo Roldan Taborda 27 minutos 19 segundos
OK, sounds good. What about? Do you need like a timestamp with hours or just timestamp?
HM
Harrison McKee
27 minutos 26 segundos27:26
Harrison McKee 27 minutos 26 segundos
No, see, this is the part that I think that this is going to be the hardest. And I'm with you, Brett, because this devils back to your conversation. The hardest part of this whole deal is going to be.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
27 minutos 28 segundos27:28
Mateo Roldan Taborda 27 minutos 28 segundos
So.
HM
Harrison McKee
27 minutos 37 segundos27:37
Harrison McKee 27 minutos 37 segundos
Camilla and them coming back in putting the cost code in the hours. Now once it goes to auto saving, that eliminates a lot of my problem. But a lot of my concern right now with hitting the save button is Jamie goes in and makes his changes, doesn't save button. Mateo doesn't know how to log time. Once auto save happens, I think that'll be fine.
BT
Brett Tatum
27 minutos 46 segundos27:46
Brett Tatum 27 minutos 46 segundos
Hmm.
Brett Tatum 27 minutos 52 segundos
Mhm.
HM
Harrison McKee
27 minutos 57 segundos27:57
Harrison McKee 27 minutos 57 segundos
Because I think it'll be a lot of Jamie's pretty good about it. Mateo's pretty good. The the poop.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
27 minutos 57 segundos27:57
Mateo Roldan Taborda 27 minutos 57 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 28 minutos 1 segundo
Sounds good. Just go ahead.
HM
Harrison McKee
28 minutos 7 segundos28:07
Harrison McKee 28 minutos 7 segundos
The two things I want to add because it comes up a lot is total crew count.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
28 minutos 14 segundos28:14
Mateo Roldan Taborda 28 minutos 14 segundos
Hmm. OK.
HM
Harrison McKee
28 minutos 14 segundos28:14
Harrison McKee 28 minutos 14 segundos
On how many guys are in this drop down list?
Harrison McKee 28 minutos 19 segundos
So like when you would hit the name, make it either say like a total number in the top left or some somehow some way. Do I have 42 guys to pull from on this list or do I have 10?
BT
Brett Tatum
28 minutos 28 segundos28:28
Brett Tatum 28 minutos 28 segundos
Hello.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
28 minutos 30 segundos28:30
Mateo Roldan Taborda 28 minutos 30 segundos
OK.
HM
Harrison McKee
28 minutos 31 segundos28:31
Harrison McKee 28 minutos 31 segundos
And then especially when we're starting to put blackout dates and like that daily crew number changes a little bit here and there. Next thing is obviously we can all count and we can tell you that we've got two going to that top line, a third one is going to that location.
Harrison McKee 28 minutos 50 segundos
But whenever you have a slew of guys and that turns to 12 to 16 to 18, it's really handy whenever there's like a number populated because you'll be on a call with Jake or somebody. Hey, yeah, I've got 16 guys coming. Four guys are framers.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
28 minutos 59 segundos28:59
Mateo Roldan Taborda 28 minutos 59 segundos
Sounds good.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 29 minutos 5 segundos
Sounds good. Would you like those stats to be like somewhere over here on the top or do you need them on the drop down?
HM
Harrison McKee
29 minutos 10 segundos29:10
Harrison McKee 29 minutos 10 segundos
Uh.
Harrison McKee 29 minutos 13 segundos
Honestly, I I don't necessarily know where it would make the most sense as much as like if it just had like you see in the employees box maybe where it just reads like a light Gray number of how many employees you have to pull from. Maybe I don't know.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
29 minutos 29 segundos29:29
Mateo Roldan Taborda 29 minutos 29 segundos
I'll put them over here in the tops and kinda like update them automatically as like as you are populating all the fields and if we need to change them we can change them on the end because I don't wanna crowd too much the the drop downs over here.
HM
Harrison McKee
29 minutos 38 segundos29:38
Harrison McKee 29 minutos 38 segundos
Yeah.
Harrison McKee 29 minutos 40 segundos
I don't think it it's not. It's not so important that needs to be bolded in your face. I just want to be able to like quickly when we have 40 guys on this list, we don't in Excel, you'd always just click the boxes and drag down and we've got 16 going to that site.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
29 minutos 46 segundos29:46
Mateo Roldan Taborda 29 minutos 46 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 29 minutos 54 segundos
True.
HM
Harrison McKee
29 minutos 55 segundos29:55
Harrison McKee 29 minutos 55 segundos
Here you're gonna be counting and counting as that list. It's the 40 and 50 guys.
Brett Tatum
29 minutos 58 segundos29:58
Brett Tatum 29 minutos 58 segundos
Does it? Does it make sense? Does it make sense to have? Does it make sense to have a whole other KPI page which would tell you like total crew available, total crew scheduled and then give you like every job that has a schedule for that day, the number of guys that are going?

Mateo Roldan Taborda
30 minutos30:00
Mateo Roldan Taborda 30 minutos
Yeah, true.
HM
Harrison McKee
30 minutos 14 segundos30:14
Harrison McKee 30 minutos 14 segundos
Yeah, if it just white one liner, like one liner going to what is that 1208 NW 194 three guys?
BT
Brett Tatum
30 minutos 15 segundos30:15
Brett Tatum 30 minutos 15 segundos
Like a dashboard.
Brett Tatum 30 minutos 22 segundos
But yeah.
Brett Tatum 30 minutos 26 segundos
Harrison, I think you're gonna want to put that in a separate tab. I feel like we're trying to do too much in one screen. So I think another another tab would say like, give me all the KPIs for the day that will be needed. And also must just go click on it and go, Oh yeah, Jake, we've got eight guys coming.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
30 minutos 29 segundos30:29
Mateo Roldan Taborda 30 minutos 29 segundos
Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 30 minutos 31 segundos
That's true.
HM
Harrison McKee
30 minutos 32 segundos30:32
Harrison McKee 30 minutos 32 segundos
OK.
Harrison McKee 30 minutos 43 segundos
And I think that little report would be nice to whenever we send these things out, that report goes to Jose's phone.

Yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda

Mateo Roldan Taborda 30 minutos 52 segundos
I love working on KPI, so like, yeah, let me create something that works for you, right? So but in a different page, let's not. Let's try to keep everything separate on a different page, right? Let's try to make schedule just in schedule. Then let's try to make a dashboard with KPIs and everything you need to know about it in a different one at the end of the day.

Harrison McKee
31 minutos 24 segundos31:24
Harrison McKee 31 minutos 24 segundos
Help me out with this KPI. Yeah, I don't understand what that is. My my question is we're not gonna have to duplicate entry between different pages, are we? It's gonna auto pull from this list and feed.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
31 minutos 28 segundos31:28
Mateo Roldan Taborda 31 minutos 28 segundos
That work I'll propose a.

Brett Tatum
31 minutos 29 segundos31:29
Brett Tatum 31 minutos 29 segundos
Yeah, and.
Brett Tatum 31 minutos 34 segundos
No, it's gonna feed, yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
31 minutos 34 segundos31:34
Mateo Roldan Taborda 31 minutos 34 segundos
No, no.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 31 minutos 36 segundos
It's going to be automatically updated, so let me work something for you and if you don't like it in the future, we can of course change it. Make sense.
BT
Brett Tatum
31 minutos 44 segundos31:44
Brett Tatum 31 minutos 44 segundos
Yeah, so Harrison, the acronym KPI stands for Key Performance Indicator. It's probably not a perfect acronym for what we're trying to do here, but it's basically just saying like, hey, what are all the important data points that you need to know for that day? And let's just put them in a dashboard where you can easily look at it as opposed to trying to complicate the storm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
31 minutos 51 segundos31:51
Mateo Roldan Taborda 31 minutos 51 segundos
Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 32 minutos 1 segundo
Figure it out.
HM
Harrison McKee
32 minutos 4 segundos32:04
Harrison McKee 32 minutos 4 segundos
Yeah, because I think that little like report at a high level, we've got six guys at this job doing drywall. We've got six guys at this job doing framing. I think that report would be beneficial to go to Jamie, Harrison, Sam, Alex.
Harrison McKee 32 minutos 19 segundos
Jose, yes, we're not getting booked to a job, but we need to know where the guys are at on a quick, handy basis.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
32 minutos 21 segundos32:21
Mateo Roldan Taborda 32 minutos 21 segundos
Sounds good.
BT
Brett Tatum
32 minutos 25 segundos32:25
Brett Tatum 32 minutos 25 segundos
Yeah, and I'm not saying you you wanna do this out of the gate, Harrison, but that would be a really beneficial feature to then send out to like superintendents like this is what you got coming tomorrow.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
32 minutos 27 segundos32:27
Mateo Roldan Taborda 32 minutos 27 segundos
Sounds good.
HM
Harrison McKee
32 minutos 37 segundos32:37
Harrison McKee 32 minutos 37 segundos
Yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
32 minutos 37 segundos32:37
Brett Tatum 32 minutos 37 segundos
Maybe, I mean, not not right now. Let's get the system dialed in, but there's there would be that flexibility I would think.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
32 minutos 38 segundos32:38
Mateo Roldan Taborda 32 minutos 38 segundos
Awesome.
HM
Harrison McKee
32 minutos 42 segundos32:42
Harrison McKee 32 minutos 42 segundos
Yeah, that'd be awesome.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
32 minutos 45 segundos32:45
Mateo Roldan Taborda 32 minutos 45 segundos
Awesome. So I'll make sure to attend to all of those now. Lastly, I always forget about telling you this, but if you want to.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 32 minutos 54 segundos
Yeah, you can increase or decrease the the the column size for you guys. So I always forget to tell you about that, but yeah, neat feature for that one. And the more rows you add with the same job, like these ones get bigger automatically as well for you up to 10 rows.
BT
Brett Tatum
32 minutos 57 segundos32:57
Brett Tatum 32 minutos 57 segundos
Uh.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
33 minutos 10 segundos33:10
Mateo Roldan Taborda 33 minutos 10 segundos
Any more than that, you'll have a gigantic box. I'm 100% sure you're not going to use all the space. And if in case you do, it'll create a kind of like a scroll within the own box and you'll be able to kind of like a scroll up and down. Lastly, export to Excel.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 33 minutos 25 segundos
Neat feature. I bet you'll need it as well. And now that's all I did last week pretty much. But now the the bad news that I have the the campaign got rejected. I need to try again. Not 100% sure what happened. Oops.
BT
Brett Tatum
33 minutos 40 segundos33:40
Brett Tatum 33 minutos 40 segundos
OK.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
33 minutos 43 segundos33:43
Mateo Roldan Taborda 33 minutos 43 segundos
Not 100% sure what happens. I'm doing my research. I do have a clue. Just give me one second.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 33 minutos 52 segundos
And.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 33 minutos 54 segundos
Let it load.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 33 minutos 59 segundos
The the campaign submission has been reviewed and rejected due to issues very verifying the call to action, which I'm not entirely sure what that means in a standpoint from Twilo, but I'm doing my research resubmitting the the campaign today itself as soon as possible.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 34 minutos 17 segundos
And then try it again, right? Because we need to get these going on. Everything's built on the back end. As soon as this is approved, I just need to do testing just to make sure everything's working correctly. But yeah, I I need to resubmit the campaign for us to be able to send SMS to all the crew.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 34 minutos 35 segundos
I wanted to get you updated on that, but yeah.
Brett Tatum
34 minutos 36 segundos34:36
Brett Tatum 34 minutos 36 segundos
Let let me know, Mateo, let me know if that's how that's going or if I can help. I I sometimes fear in these things that like maybe because your IP is out of like Columbia that.
Brett Tatum 34 minutos 48 segundos
Someone is going, oh, that deal like why is a why is Columbia setting up a text message system for AUS company? So if if something needs to be done for my machine, possibly. Um.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
34 minutos 48 segundos34:48
Mateo Roldan Taborda 34 minutos 48 segundos
True.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 34 minutos 58 segundos
Mm-hmm. I'll do my research today. This is the very first thing that I'm going to be doing today for today. Like my whole purpose for today is to figure these out. And then if I have time today, I'll start doing the everything that we talked to for for the scheduler.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 35 minutos 14 segundos
I'm sorry for the crew tracker, but this is my main focus. I just wanna figure out what is going on, how we can, how can I make sure that this doesn't happen in the future, right? But yeah, just wanted to update you on this because yeah, unfortunately got reject.
BT
Brett Tatum
35 minutos 22 segundos35:22
Brett Tatum 35 minutos 22 segundos
Right.
Brett Tatum 35 minutos 28 segundos
OK. Hey, can we can we switch back over to to Bolt here? I got two more things. I wanna see if there are features that Harrison would prefer to have. So for me it feels like a lot to look at all of these lines blank.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
35 minutos 30 segundos35:30
Mateo Roldan Taborda 35 minutos 30 segundos
Yes.
BT
Brett Tatum
35 minutos 42 segundos35:42
Brett Tatum 35 minutos 42 segundos
Harrison, would it be better if like once you fill in a line, the next line pops up?
HM
Harrison McKee
35 minutos 46 segundos35:46
Harrison McKee 35 minutos 46 segundos
Yep, like you, you always only have the employee and one blank under it.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
35 minutos 52 segundos35:52
Mateo Roldan Taborda 35 minutos 52 segundos
OK, sounds good. Yeah, absolutely.
BT
Brett Tatum
35 minutos 52 segundos35:52
Brett Tatum 35 minutos 52 segundos
Is that possible?
HM
Harrison McKee
35 minutos 53 segundos35:53
Harrison McKee 35 minutos 53 segundos
And as you do click the next employee, then it automatically adds a row. It automatically adds a row that that's the same thing Jamie said down at the very bottom where the side to sidebar is, you gotta you have to scroll all the way down to grab the side to sidebar and you pass 30 empty spaces to get to it.
BT
Brett Tatum
36 minutos 4 segundos36:04
Brett Tatum 36 minutos 4 segundos
Yeah, so far away.
HM
Harrison McKee
36 minutos 11 segundos36:11
Harrison McKee 36 minutos 11 segundos
Can you lock that at the top?

Mateo Roldan Taborda
36 minutos 11 segundos36:11
Mateo Roldan Taborda 36 minutos 11 segundos
Yeah, absolutely.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 36 minutos 13 segundos
Yeah, absolutely. I'll make sure to to create that functionality. I just made default 30 because I saw on the sheet that you guys have like 30-40 people at the same like for the whole day, right. So I just wanted to make sure that you have in our froze. But yeah, I'll 100% make sure that as soon as you click on an employee that the next line appears so that.
Brett Tatum
36 minutos 26 segundos36:26
Brett Tatum 36 minutos 26 segundos
And then?

Mateo Roldan Taborda
36 minutos 33 segundos36:33
Mateo Roldan Taborda 36 minutos 33 segundos
You don't get crowded with that many rows.
HM
Harrison McKee
36 minutos 35 segundos36:35
Harrison McKee 36 minutos 35 segundos
And then my my question is if let's say yesterday I sent 18 guys to loves to do drywall framing, sheet rock, this, that and the other. Is there a way to like almost like copy that and move it forward into today?
BT
Brett Tatum
36 minutos 35 segundos36:35
Brett Tatum 36 minutos 35 segundos
The last. Oh, go ahead, Harrison.
Brett Tatum 36 minutos 49 segundos
Duplicate.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
36 minutos 50 segundos36:50
Mateo Roldan Taborda 36 minutos 50 segundos
Not yet, but I can definitely create that fairly easy as well.
BT
Brett Tatum
36 minutos 52 segundos36:52
Brett Tatum 36 minutos 52 segundos
I was gonna Pearson what I was gonna suggest on that is just an option where you can say like duplicate day, like duplicate day and then tell it what day to go to. So it's like hey this is the 18th I want to duplicate this and I want it to be the 19th and you click that and then like.
HM
Harrison McKee
37 minutos 2 segundos37:02
Harrison McKee 37 minutos 2 segundos
Yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
37 minutos 8 segundos37:08
Brett Tatum 37 minutos 8 segundos
Now your 19th looks the same. I think it might be tough to only duplicate certain people or certain projects, but like, if you knew you're close enough on the whole day and you're like, hey, I'm gonna go change the six guys that are different, that's easier than.
HM
Harrison McKee
37 minutos 13 segundos37:13
Harrison McKee 37 minutos 13 segundos
Yeah.
Harrison McKee 37 minutos 20 segundos
Yeah, that's that's what I'd say. Duplicate the whole day and then let me adjust because sometimes it's out of the 30 guys, 28 of them are doing the exact same thing they did yesterday.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
37 minutos 20 segundos37:20
Mateo Roldan Taborda 37 minutos 20 segundos
Mm-hmm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 37 minutos 30 segundos
Sounds good. Then let me ask you something, which columns will be important for me to duplicate? Because that's fairly easy done. I can actually just take information from one day and push it to the next one. So I am I'm imagining employee cost code W2 hours job.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 37 minutos 47 segundos
Address, of course.
HM
Harrison McKee
37 minutos 47 segundos37:47
Harrison McKee 37 minutos 47 segundos
Not, not ours, not ours. It would be employee, cost code, job, schedule task, obviously the address and.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
37 minutos 49 segundos37:49
Mateo Roldan Taborda 37 minutos 49 segundos
Under hours.
HM
Harrison McKee
38 minutos 2 segundos38:02
Harrison McKee 38 minutos 2 segundos
That should be it.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
38 minutos 4 segundos38:04
Mateo Roldan Taborda 38 minutos 4 segundos
Sounds good. Yeah, that's really easy. Oh.
BT
Brett Tatum
38 minutos 5 segundos38:05
Brett Tatum 38 minutos 5 segundos
Materials needed.
HM
Harrison McKee
38 minutos 6 segundos38:06
Harrison McKee 38 minutos 6 segundos
Materials needed might, I would say leave that one different because like that'll probably change.
BT
Brett Tatum
38 minutos 11 segundos38:11
Brett Tatum 38 minutos 11 segundos
Yep, that'll change. That makes sense. OK.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
38 minutos 13 segundos38:13
Mateo Roldan Taborda 38 minutos 13 segundos
OK, sounds good. I'll make sure to change that as well. Um.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 38 minutos 21 segundos
Also, whenever you guys do have a chance, um, you can already start filling out the employees here. Uh.
HM
Harrison McKee
38 minutos 27 segundos38:27
Harrison McKee 38 minutos 27 segundos
That one might have Mateo work on that today.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
38 minutos 29 segundos38:29
Mateo Roldan Taborda 38 minutos 29 segundos
You can add as many as you want. Then one more thing here for you while I work on that. Give me a list of the cost codes right? Because otherwise you'll have to copy and paste them over here manually 1 by 1.
BT
Brett Tatum
38 minutos 30 segundos38:30
Brett Tatum 38 minutos 30 segundos
That that that's work.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
38 minutos 45 segundos38:45
Mateo Roldan Taborda 38 minutos 45 segundos
Um, give me all the cost codes you currently work on. That's something that personally I have no idea what that is. So just give me a list of all of the ones that you.
BT
Brett Tatum
38 minutos 54 segundos38:54
Brett Tatum 38 minutos 54 segundos
You want me to give them the X? You want me to give them the export out of red team Harrison, or do you want a more refined list?
HM
Harrison McKee
38 minutos 57 segundos38:57
Harrison McKee 38 minutos 57 segundos
Yeah, you can give them the export out of red team, but I'll probably.
Harrison McKee 39 minutos 5 segundos
I mean, I guess it's probably worth having all of them. I'd like it to where, you know, it kind of auto populates like their name. You start typing 09 and you're you're limited to flooring or finishes type list, you know what I mean?
BT
Brett Tatum
39 minutos 18 segundos39:18
Brett Tatum 39 minutos 18 segundos
Well, then let's go through me and you. Let's do that together, Harrison, and let's talk about what what we do want to see and don't. I don't know how smart we can make it. Um.
HM
Harrison McKee
39 minutos 23 segundos39:23
Harrison McKee 39 minutos 23 segundos
Yeah.
Harrison McKee 39 minutos 26 segundos
No, with you.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
39 minutos 28 segundos39:28
Mateo Roldan Taborda 39 minutos 28 segundos
As smart as you want. I personally I have no idea what like those codification actually means. So I will need a kind of like a if you want it super complex, I will need to be on that meeting just to kind of like get to know, understand what that means. But.
BT
Brett Tatum
39 minutos 28 segundos39:28
Brett Tatum 39 minutos 28 segundos
But yeah.
HM
Harrison McKee
39 minutos 42 segundos39:42
Harrison McKee 39 minutos 42 segundos
All it is, is that it's telling you what bucket to throw that labor money in.
BT
Brett Tatum
39 minutos 48 segundos39:48
Brett Tatum 39 minutos 48 segundos
Yeah, like I'll show you here real quick if you can see my screen. So like this would be the export we would give you.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
39 minutos 49 segundos39:49
Mateo Roldan Taborda 39 minutos 49 segundos
Uh, OK.
HM
Harrison McKee
39 minutos 50 segundos39:50
Harrison McKee 39 minutos 50 segundos
So.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
39 minutos 55 segundos39:55
Mateo Roldan Taborda 39 minutos 55 segundos
Wait, I don't see your screen. One second. One second. Here we go.
BT
Brett Tatum
40 minutos40:00
Brett Tatum 40 minutos
That's like we have 01000 general requirements, 01740 cleaning, 02000 site construction. Um, so Harrison, you've got 67.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
40 minutos 4 segundos40:04
Mateo Roldan Taborda 40 minutos 4 segundos
Oh.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 40 minutos 12 segundos
Oh.
HM
Harrison McKee
40 minutos 13 segundos40:13
Harrison McKee 40 minutos 13 segundos
Yeah, we don't. We don't need all of those.
BT
Brett Tatum
40 minutos 14 segundos40:14
Brett Tatum 40 minutos 14 segundos
Um.
Brett Tatum 40 minutos 16 segundos
Yeah. So anyways, you and I'll go through it, Harrison. I would say though that there's probably some some reason to, well, maybe not 'cause you do sub out some things, so you don't wanna limit your red team list just down to your labor. But so yeah, that's fine, we'll we'll we'll consolidate it.
HM
Harrison McKee
40 minutos 20 segundos40:20
Harrison McKee 40 minutos 20 segundos
Yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
40 minutos 32 segundos40:32
Brett Tatum 40 minutos 32 segundos
Um.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
40 minutos 32 segundos40:32
Mateo Roldan Taborda 40 minutos 32 segundos
OK, sounds good. Yeah, just give me if you can give me an Excel sheet with like probably the same columns here, except with a QuickBooks because we don't have any integration to to that app at least yet, right? I can integrate that to Bolt.
Brett Tatum
40 minutos 50 segundos40:50
Brett Tatum 40 minutos 50 segundos
I need to check with.
Brett Tatum 40 minutos 53 segundos
Why those are broken to QuickBooks might be something to look into. Um.
Brett Tatum 40 minutos 58 segundos
Last question I had for you, Harrison, was do we need to give employees a unique number identifier?
Brett Tatum 41 minutos 9 segundos
Or some sort of feel 'cause like you do, you do have four to five Jose's working. Like how do you want to distinguish between those guys 'cause I mean first name, last name or is it? Is that even enough?

Mateo Roldan Taborda
41 minutos 13 segundos41:13
Mateo Roldan Taborda 41 minutos 13 segundos
OK.
HM
Harrison McKee
41 minutos 21 segundos41:21
Harrison McKee 41 minutos 21 segundos
We've been doing first name, last name, but we've got a junior and a senior now first name, last name. I I wouldn't be against having some sort of number identifier. The real issue is like whenever I feel like that's gonna be a very important thing for Jose and Camila more than anybody.
BT
Brett Tatum
41 minutos 27 segundos41:27
Brett Tatum 41 minutos 27 segundos
And also.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
41 minutos 29 segundos41:29
Mateo Roldan Taborda 41 minutos 29 segundos
I did.
HM
Harrison McKee
41 minutos 41 segundos41:41
Harrison McKee 41 minutos 41 segundos
Because whenever we go back to that bolt layout page, like the schedule, how it's gonna work is on that schedule when you click it, the schedule real quick.
BT
Brett Tatum
41 minutos 41 segundos41:41
Brett Tatum 41 minutos 41 segundos
I agree.
Brett Tatum 41 minutos 51 segundos
Sorry, I'm on it now.
HM
Harrison McKee
41 minutos 56 segundos41:56
Harrison McKee 41 minutos 56 segundos
Jamie and myself will only put a employee in if we are like that's like our call for we. I need Chase on this job for XYZ reason. I told Brett Chase will be there, whatever. So I'll click Chase. I'll go to the job location, but then I might leave the next.
Harrison McKee 42 minutos 15 segundos
Eight under him, completely blank for Camilla and Jose to pick who's going.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
42 minutos 21 segundos42:21
Mateo Roldan Taborda 42 minutos 21 segundos
Mm.
BT
Brett Tatum
42 minutos 21 segundos42:21
Brett Tatum 42 minutos 21 segundos
But then you're just then, but see, based on what we're talking about, adding the new lines and stuff like that, then you're gonna have to put a bunch of backyards in, right?
HM
Harrison McKee
42 minutos 30 segundos42:30
Harrison McKee 42 minutos 30 segundos
Yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
42 minutos 32 segundos42:32
Mateo Roldan Taborda 42 minutos 32 segundos
Oh.
BT
Brett Tatum
42 minutos 32 segundos42:32
Brett Tatum 42 minutos 32 segundos
Which I'm sure you're willing to do.
HM
Harrison McKee
42 minutos 32 segundos42:32
Harrison McKee 42 minutos 32 segundos
Yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
42 minutos 34 segundos42:34
Mateo Roldan Taborda 42 minutos 34 segundos
What about like now that we talked about changing that functionality, how would you feel if I add a separator option over there so you can avoid that? So for example.
HM
Harrison McKee
42 minutos 44 segundos42:44
Harrison McKee 42 minutos 44 segundos
Just hit. You just hit eight and it gives you 7 blank rows under it.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
42 minutos 49 segundos42:49
Mateo Roldan Taborda 42 minutos 49 segundos
Mm-hmm. And then a visual separated as well.
Harrison McKee
42 minutos 53 segundos42:53
Harrison McKee 42 minutos 53 segundos
Yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
42 minutos 53 segundos42:53
Brett Tatum 42 minutos 53 segundos
OK, I see what you're saying. A break, yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
42 minutos 54 segundos42:54
Mateo Roldan Taborda 42 minutos 54 segundos
Does that work?
Mateo Roldan Taborda 42 minutos 56 segundos
Sounds good. Yeah, I can actually add that for you.
HM
Harrison McKee
42 minutos 58 segundos42:58
Harrison McKee 42 minutos 58 segundos
Yeah, that'd be awesome. So you hit that and hit 98, whatever and it kind of like locks you in.
BT
Brett Tatum
42 minutos 58 segundos42:58
Brett Tatum 42 minutos 58 segundos
Good.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
43 minutos 4 segundos43:04
Mateo Roldan Taborda 43 minutos 4 segundos
It locks you in then with a visual separator. I don't know, just kind of like I saw that you guys use kind of like a black row, like literally just a black a color, but kind of like the same thing. You just add a separator for you to visually organize yourself.
HM
Harrison McKee
43 minutos 11 segundos43:11
Harrison McKee 43 minutos 11 segundos
That's to separate between the days.
BT
Brett Tatum
43 minutos 12 segundos43:12
Brett Tatum 43 minutos 12 segundos
Yeah, yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
43 minutos 21 segundos43:21
Mateo Roldan Taborda 43 minutos 21 segundos
That's what I mean.
HM
Harrison McKee
43 minutos 21 segundos43:21
Harrison McKee 43 minutos 21 segundos
Yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
43 minutos 23 segundos43:23
Mateo Roldan Taborda 43 minutos 23 segundos
OK, sounds good.
BT
Brett Tatum
43 minutos 24 segundos43:24
Brett Tatum 43 minutos 24 segundos
So I guess my thought over here, sorry, circling back to employee Harrison, like do we wanna give a nickname field where it's like if it's blank you just don't see it anywhere. But if someone does have a nickname in or an alias when you're in schedule?
HM
Harrison McKee
43 minutos 37 segundos43:37
Harrison McKee 43 minutos 37 segundos
Yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
43 minutos 39 segundos43:39
Brett Tatum 43 minutos 39 segundos
It pops down and says Jamie and then like in parentheses it says, you know, you know, Superman, right? And you know, and and that way, like if Camilla and Jose be like, hey, look, we're gonna call this guy Bonito, you know, I don't know, like that shows up in parentheses.
HM
Harrison McKee
43 minutos 44 segundos43:44
Harrison McKee 43 minutos 44 segundos
Amito. Whatever. Yeah.
Harrison McKee 43 minutos 51 segundos
Yeah, yeah.
Harrison McKee 43 minutos 55 segundos
Yes. No, I think that'd be smart because there is. It does get to a point where you've got four people with the same first names and it's you could very easily send the guy who's good at painting Jamie who a guy that should have been framing Jamie.
Brett Tatum
44 minutos 10 segundos44:10
Brett Tatum 44 minutos 10 segundos
Is that a big? I mean, I say that's pretty easy. Can we just get when we add an employee? Can we have an optional name? And I would clarify first and last and then alias or nickname. What do you prefer, Harrison?

Mateo Roldan Taborda
44 minutos 12 segundos44:12
Mateo Roldan Taborda 44 minutos 12 segundos
Sounds good.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 44 minutos 20 segundos
Nickname.
HM
Harrison McKee
44 minutos 23 segundos44:23
Harrison McKee 44 minutos 23 segundos
Yeah, first and last and I would say nickname would be better.
BT
Brett Tatum
44 minutos 26 segundos44:26
Brett Tatum 44 minutos 26 segundos
Yeah, yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
44 minutos 28 segundos44:28
Mateo Roldan Taborda 44 minutos 28 segundos
This is good. Why not? Instead of first name and last name, I'll just say full name and then nickname.
BT
Brett Tatum
44 minutos 38 segundos44:38
Brett Tatum 44 minutos 38 segundos
Yeah, and I know, Mateo, this is something you kind of do like where you just have the name. I mean, my preference is to have a first name field and a last name field. It just it's just better for data integrity, I think.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
44 minutos 45 segundos44:45
Mateo Roldan Taborda 44 minutos 45 segundos
Uh, OK.
HM
Harrison McKee
44 minutos 47 segundos44:47
Harrison McKee 44 minutos 47 segundos
Yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
44 minutos 49 segundos44:49
Mateo Roldan Taborda 44 minutos 49 segundos
OK, sounds good.
HM
Harrison McKee
44 minutos 49 segundos44:49
Harrison McKee 44 minutos 49 segundos
People put it in the wrong, wrong order or don't capitalize something or yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
44 minutos 50 segundos44:50
Brett Tatum 44 minutos 50 segundos
Yeah, so.
Brett Tatum 44 minutos 53 segundos
Exactly. First name, last name, nickname would be preferred.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
44 minutos 55 segundos44:55
Mateo Roldan Taborda 44 minutos 55 segundos
OK, sounds good.

Yep.
HM
Harrison McKee
45 minutos 54 segundos45:54
Harrison McKee 45 minutos 54 segundos
Is there a way to run a report or if I at a quick glance were to ask you, you know how many guys did you have over the past two weeks working?

Mateo Roldan Taborda
46 minutos 4 segundos46:04
Mateo Roldan Taborda 46 minutos 4 segundos
Yeah, of course.
HM
Harrison McKee
46 minutos 5 segundos46:05
Harrison McKee 46 minutos 5 segundos
Now, how would you pull that information from here right now?
BT
Brett Tatum
46 minutos 9 segundos46:09
Brett Tatum 46 minutos 9 segundos
You couldn't right now, probably. I mean, the data's there, we don't.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
46 minutos 12 segundos46:12
Mateo Roldan Taborda 46 minutos 12 segundos
That is there like I don't have.
HM
Harrison McKee
46 minutos 12 segundos46:12
Harrison McKee 46 minutos 12 segundos
I know that is that like I could go back day by day and write it down in a journal, but like how do you get to where if I said how many, how many guys did you average working last June?

Mateo Roldan Taborda
46 minutos 24 segundos46:24
Mateo Roldan Taborda 46 minutos 24 segundos
Well, I don't have the answer for that at the moment, but like, it will depend on what data do you specifically need. And I can pretty much customize it to anything you want. That's the short answer. Like anything you need for a KPI, I can make it happen here. So yeah, don't stress it. I'll give you something simple at the beginning and then we can make a more.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 46 minutos 44 segundos
Complex as you need it, right? Just gonna give you a hint of what's capable and if you do end up needing something more bands, we can definitely work on it too. Like we've done in the past like pretty in depth KPIs for Tatco company for example, right? So.
HM
Harrison McKee
46 minutos 47 segundos46:47
Harrison McKee 46 minutos 47 segundos
Yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
47 minutos 2 segundos47:02
Mateo Roldan Taborda 47 minutos 2 segundos
Don't worry, like it'll be possible to make it.
BT
Brett Tatum
47 minutos 5 segundos47:05
Brett Tatum 47 minutos 5 segundos
If the data's there, Harrison, we can we can compile it, filter it, sort it, show it however we want to. It's just part of it's gonna be compiling some data, so we actually have information to start pulling together.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
47 minutos 11 segundos47:11
Mateo Roldan Taborda 47 minutos 11 segundos
Yeah.
HM
Harrison McKee
47 minutos 12 segundos47:12

Mateo Roldan Taborda
47 minutos 20 segundos47:20
Mateo Roldan Taborda 47 minutos 20 segundos
And at the end of the day, you already are compiling a lot of information. Sorry, you already have employees, job schedules, messages. You have plenty of information to go to, right? Sorry.
Brett Tatum
47 minutos 20 segundos47:20
Brett Tatum 47 minutos 20 segundos
But.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
47 minutos 37 segundos47:37
Mateo Roldan Taborda 47 minutos 37 segundos

Brett Tatum 47 minutos 53 segundos
She probably doesn't right now.
HM
Harrison McKee
47 minutos 55 segundos47:55
Harrison McKee 47 minutos 55 segundos
'Cause my my ask is like as soon as even right now the Excel folder it is admin at FD.
BT
Brett Tatum
47 minutos 59 segundos47:59
Brett Tatum 47 minutos 59 segundos
What's Camilla's e-mail?
Brett Tatum 48 minutos 5 segundos
OK.
HM
Harrison McKee
48 minutos 8 segundos48:08
Harrison McKee 48 minutos 8 segundos
Right now, right now we're running on the Excel folder, which already doesn't have the text messaging capabilities and so on and so forth. And I'm wondering at what point do I just start like, hey Jamie?
BT
Brett Tatum
48 minutos 8 segundos48:08
Brett Tatum 48 minutos 8 segundos
Yeah, keep going.
HM
Harrison McKee
48 minutos 24 segundos48:24
Harrison McKee 48 minutos 24 segundos
Pause the Excel, start running out of Bolt. Are we a week from that or?
BT
Brett Tatum
48 minutos 31 segundos48:31
Brett Tatum 48 minutos 31 segundos
I would say, Harrison, you're probably at a point where like we can start putting data in.
Brett Tatum 48 minutos 39 segundos
But you need to run both Simon, like you need to keep doing your Excel sheet as well.
HM
Harrison McKee
48 minutos 44 segundos48:44
Harrison McKee 48 minutos 44 segundos
until until we're keyed all the way up here.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
48 minutos 45 segundos48:45
Mateo Roldan Taborda 48 minutos 45 segundos
The yes. So the biggest bottleneck that I can actually tell you right now is Twilo. Twilo is completely out of my hands, unfortunately, because that's the that is not the back end. The back end I built it, but that's the system we use to be able to deliver messages, right? So Twilo, it's kind of like the phone call.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 49 minutos 5 segundos
Company kind of like what you guys have, I don't know, tell us or I honestly don't know any phone companies over there in the US, but it's the phone AT&T. There you go. It's kind of like the AT&T that it will allow you to send SMS legally within the US, right? So.
BT
Brett Tatum
49 minutos 14 segundos49:14
Brett Tatum 49 minutos 14 segundos
AT&T.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
49 minutos 24 segundos49:24
Mateo Roldan Taborda 49 minutos 24 segundos
That's kinda like.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 49 minutos 27 segundos
The the middle man between us and actually sending text messages to your people. So unfortunately like I'm trying to do everything as quickly as possible on my end, but like we are dealing with with our, I don't know, company bureaucracy on how much they actually take to review those companies once that's set up.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 49 minutos 47 segundos
We're good to go. My guess it took a week for that for the first one to get approved, so we'll be able to circle back again next Monday on that. And within this week I'm going to be solely focused on all of the changes you requested.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 50 minutos 2 segundos
And all of the new additions we're going to make to the crew tracker. So I'll believe if everything goes according to plan, we should be able to. And if they approve the next campaign, we should be able to roll out either Tuesday or Wednesday next week, somewhere within that area. But at the moment this week is for me to be able to deliver everything we talked.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 50 minutos 21 segundos
Talked about this on this call and to make sure that we have everything necessary for at least an MVP. Now if you do have additional changes when like this MVP rolls out, we're I'm happy to of course make them for you as well, but we'll need to plan when that time comes.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 50 minutos 39 segundos
Make sense?
HM
Harrison McKee
50 minutos 39 segundos50:39
Harrison McKee 50 minutos 39 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum
50 minutos 40 segundos50:40
Brett Tatum 50 minutos 40 segundos
Yeah, and we, I mean they need a period of time to be entering and build like building the schedules each day without sending SMS text because first thing we want to do is make sure it works internally before we start using it for the notifications.
HM
Harrison McKee
50 minutos 51 segundos50:51
Harrison McKee 50 minutos 51 segundos
Yeah.
Harrison McKee 50 minutos 56 segundos
Yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
50 minutos 57 segundos50:57
Brett Tatum 50 minutos 57 segundos
So if that can happen, you know, sometime this week, Mateo, as soon as you feel like it's ready for them to start getting into.
HM
Harrison McKee
51 minutos 3 segundos51:03
Harrison McKee 51 minutos 3 segundos
Yeah, I'd wait till the changes are kind of made, and the main reason I say is it's a lot easier to teach them the whole thing in the capabilities than kind of sprinkling a change throughout the process.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
51 minutos 5 segundos51:05
Mateo Roldan Taborda 51 minutos 5 segundos
Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 51 minutos 15 segundos
Yeah, of course. And and I'll make as soon as everything's ready, I'll make a video of kind of like a tutorial for them to explaining everything so you don't have to jump and start guessing how how everything works. I'll make sure to fill in on the on the blanks for the details of this app and just to make sure that everything's working for you guys.
BT
Brett Tatum
51 minutos 16 segundos51:16
Brett Tatum 51 minutos 16 segundos
Yeah.
HM
Harrison McKee
51 minutos 33 segundos51:33
Harrison McKee 51 minutos 33 segundos
Brett, is it worth and I'm I'm understanding Twillo to be like its own carrier. Is it worth trying to link with a carrier here?
BT
Brett Tatum
51 minutos 44 segundos51:44
Brett Tatum 51 minutos 44 segundos
Well, Twillo's not it's, it's US based, it's not, it's not foreign based. It's really what it is like we there's all different kinds of.
HM
Harrison McKee
51 minutos 44 segundos51:44
Harrison McKee 51 minutos 44 segundos
I do you think?
Harrison McKee 51 minutos 48 segundos
OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
51 minutos 53 segundos51:53
Brett Tatum 51 minutos 53 segundos
You know, SMS text message notification system. So certainly if Twillo doesn't work again, we might have to switch to another platform. It just has to be something that integrates with our database, has to be something that gives us the functionality. And so Mateo did that research to determine that Twillo would be the best option.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
52 minutos 1 segundo52:01
Mateo Roldan Taborda 52 minutos 1 segundo
Yep.
HM
Harrison McKee
52 minutos 6 segundos52:06
Harrison McKee 52 minutos 6 segundos
I got you.
Harrison McKee 52 minutos 11 segundos
I gotcha. I gotcha.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
52 minutos 12 segundos52:12
Mateo Roldan Taborda 52 minutos 12 segundos
And the reason I choose Twilo is honestly because they have a really big developer kind of like source space. I've heard of Twilo from many years ago as well. I know the projects that I've worked on in the past, but Twilo is always the one that comes down to the top, like the biggest one, the one that has the most.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 52 minutos 31 segundos
Ford on, but again, because it's a huge company, it does have its its kind of like considerations and workarounds.
HM
Harrison McKee
52 minutos 38 segundos52:38
Harrison McKee 52 minutos 38 segundos
Yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
52 minutos 41 segundos52:41

We'll we'll solve this. This is this is something just got crossed up in their back back office, which is frustrating, but we'll get it. We'll get this quarter one.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
52 minutos 42 segundos52:42
Mateo Roldan Taborda 52 minutos 42 segundos
Yeah.
HM
Harrison McKee
52 minutos 48 segundos52:48
Harrison McKee 52 minutos 48 segundos

Mateo Roldan Taborda

Harrison McKee 52 minutos 52 segundos
Yes.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
52 minutos 52 segundos52:52
Mateo Roldan Taborda 52 minutos 52 segundos
We'll get it going, but yeah, so it was a really good meeting with you to today guys. So I'll get every, I'll get started right away to all of the changes again, just gonna like to set expectations. My focus for today is Twilo. If I'm if I do have enough time by the end of the day, I'll start doing all of the changes on.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 53 minutos 12 segundos
And as always, I'll keep you updated on every change I make.
