No, I get that completely. I just had like two more ideas come into my head and I was like, I might as well get them in front of him now. So if it affects how he changes some stuff, you know what I'm thinking.

Mateo Roldan Taborda

OK, so I added all the employees. The that was an easy process. That worked great. I know when we talked about the schedule, you talked about making it to where we can delete the names and.

Harrison McKee 0 minutos 46 segundos
No, that that's good. The two things I wanted to talk about real quick is I would like to add a like a column in here that shows what time they're required to be on that location.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
0 minutos 53 segundos0:53
Mateo Roldan Taborda 0 minutos 53 segundos

Mateo Roldan Taborda 0 minutos 59 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 5 segundos

HM

Harrison McKee
1 minuto 7 segundos1:07
Harrison McKee 1 minuto 7 segundos
I would like it to default to like 7:00 AM.
Harrison McKee 1 minuto 12 segundos
But but have the ability for me to change it. And the reason I say it is 80% of the time they show up at 7:00 AM and that's they would just know that even if it wasn't there. But I would still like to have a time slotted in case it's hey.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 12 segundos1:12
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 12 segundos
Sounds good.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 24 segundos
OK.
HM

Harrison McKee

You know you got to show up at the school and the school doesn't want you there till 1:00 PM.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 36 segundos1:36
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 36 segundos
Sounds good. Yeah, I can definitely add that for you. Quick question for you. Would you like that to be only available for you or all of the accounts across FD company?
HM
Harrison McKee
1 minuto 48 segundos1:48
Harrison McKee 1 minuto 48 segundos
All the accounts, I would say whenever we have a.
Harrison McKee 1 minuto 54 segundos
I would say just label the account and label it or put it to where everybody can see it. Me, Jamie, Mateo, someone, so forth. But where it says like Showtime or start time, start work time, whatever. And I can put the time there. And the reason I say that is exactly that like there's.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
2 minutos 1 segundo2:01
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 1 segundo
Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 6 segundos
Mhm.

Times where we have day crews, there's times where we have night crews, there's times where we have mid-day starts.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
2 minutos 20 segundos2:20
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 20 segundos
OK.
HM
Harrison McKee
2 minutos 21 segundos2:21
Harrison McKee 2 minutos 21 segundos
Another thing which may already be able to be integrated on your end, I would like to have a preset these. So right now there's 32 names in here, right? Let's say that tomorrow I booked.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
2 minutos 27 segundos2:27
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 27 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 34 segundos
Yes.
HM
Harrison McKee
2 minutos 42 segundos2:42
Harrison McKee 2 minutos 42 segundos
15 guys to work and the other 17 for XYZ reason can't work because we don't have a spot for them that day.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
2 minutos 42 segundos2:42
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 42 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 49 segundos
Mhm.
HM
Harrison McKee
2 minutos 50 segundos2:50
Harrison McKee 2 minutos 50 segundos
I would like them to get like a notification or slate it to where if you are an active employee and you were not assigned a task, you got a notification stating hey you have no scheduled work today, please check back in by tomorrow at.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
2 minutos 58 segundos2:58
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 58 segundos
Mm-hmm.
HM
Harrison McKee
3 minutos 9 segundos3:09
Harrison McKee 3 minutos 9 segundos
Five. You, you, you know what I mean? Like basically I don't want them left wondering, hey, did the text go out? Did it not go out? If it's something where we're not gonna use them and we're done working with them for whatever reason.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 11 segundos3:11
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 11 segundos
Got it. Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 18 segundos
OK.
HM
Harrison McKee
3 minutos 25 segundos3:25
Harrison McKee 3 minutos 25 segundos
But basically for firing them, we can always inactive, we can change and when they're inactive, nobody would get that automatic text. It's only active employees not booked tomorrow will get that text.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 29 segundos3:29
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 29 segundos
Mm-hmm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 36 segundos
Yep.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 39 segundos
Sounds good. So yeah, pretty much what you're saying over here is even if they haven't been assigned into the next day, but they're still active, they just get the notification, hey, no work today, that's it.
HM
Harrison McKee
3 minutos 51 segundos3:51
Harrison McKee 3 minutos 51 segundos
Yeah, no work today. Check back or any questions, call Jose. We can we can tweet that little message, but I just want something to where it's that. And then I also wanted a way to have like on this message tab somewhere.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 58 segundos3:58
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 58 segundos
Yeah, of course.

Where I could have like an all hands feed. Same thing where it goes to all in all 32 or however many people are in here. Hey, be careful. The roads are icy due to the ice. We're not coming to work today. Everybody enjoy your day off to wear like bulk messages.

Harrison McKee 4 minutos 41 segundos
I just had those couple quick ideas and just wanted to add them to your plate. So I didn't know if it was going to change the order or how you had to do something. I didn't want you to have to back out, you know what I mean? So.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
4 minutos 50 segundos4:50
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 50 segundos
Yeah, of course. Completely understandable. Just a quick question over here because I'm, I'm still fairly new to the whole company, right? Did you run these by by Brett too?

Mateo Roldan Taborda
5 minutos 8 segundos5:08
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 8 segundos
For you, for you. No, I completely agree. And I'm going to do it, so no worries. It's just that, yeah, again, I'm fairly new to the company, so I'm not sure how like those requests works.
HM
Harrison McKee
5 minutos 17 segundos5:17
Harrison McKee 5 minutos 17 segundos
Me and Brett are partnered on FD.

Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 35 segundos
Well, hopefully by our next call, which is scheduled by Monday to Monday. Sorry. But yeah, this is just a few more things that I'll that I'll do. But yeah, everything's on schedule. I'll make sure to have these new requirements for you ready as well. And in the meantime, if you do have.

Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 20 segundos
Yeah, of course. Yeah, I'll change it for that.
HM

6 minutos 25 segundos6:25
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 25 segundos
So it's good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm happy to make that change for you. It's it's an issue.
