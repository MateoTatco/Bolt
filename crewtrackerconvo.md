Harrison McKee 0 minutos 12 segundos
Alrighty. Well, I think this thing is pretty stinking sweet, but I wanted to kind of talk about a few tweaks or ads that as I was kind of playing around with it and get an idea of what would be useful and so on and so forth.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
0 minutos 14 segundos0:14
Mateo Roldan Taborda 0 minutos 14 segundos
Um.
HM

Harrison McKee
0 minutos 28 segundos0:28
Harrison McKee 0 minutos 28 segundos
I'm going to share my screen and then I'll kind of talk as I'm driving.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
0 minutos 28 segundos0:28
Mateo Roldan Taborda 0 minutos 28 segundos
Yeah, absolutely.
BT

Brett Tatum
0 minutos 32 segundos0:32
Brett Tatum 0 minutos 32 segundos
Yeah, share your screen.
HM

Harrison McKee
0 minutos 34 segundos0:34
Harrison McKee 0 minutos 34 segundos
OK, so.
Harrison McKee 0 minutos 36 segundos
I understand you.
BT

Brett Tatum
0 minutos 37 segundos0:37
Brett Tatum 0 minutos 37 segundos
And Mateo, I'm recording too, so you'll have the transcript.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
0 minutos 38 segundos0:38
Mateo Roldan Taborda 0 minutos 38 segundos
Yep.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 0 minutos 40 segundos
Awesome. Thank you.
HM

Harrison McKee
0 minutos 43 segundos0:43
Harrison McKee 0 minutos 43 segundos
I I pretty much get the basic layout of this. This all makes sense. This is clean, easy to use. I don't really have anything to change per se other than this. The active inactive employees, I'm assuming you can filter that, toggle it on and off, and it's not like once they're inactive, you can't just bring them back, correct?

Mateo Roldan Taborda
0 minutos 48 segundos0:48
Mateo Roldan Taborda 0 minutos 48 segundos
Hmm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 1 segundo
Yeah, you can switch them back whenever you want. It's just in case. Mm-hmm.
HM

Harrison McKee
1 minuto 3 segundos1:03
Harrison McKee 1 minuto 3 segundos
OK, the reason I ask is we'll have guys that'll take like a three month break and then come back to work for us.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 7 segundos1:07
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 7 segundos
Yep, absolutely. Yeah, no problem. Like you can switch them like fairly easy. Either you can click on the active status over there without even having to go to to over there and it'll change them right away. So yeah, it's just for you to have a list of the people.
HM

Harrison McKee
1 minuto 22 segundos1:22
Harrison McKee 1 minuto 22 segundos
Sorry.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 27 segundos1:27
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 27 segundos
Who are currently working, people who will take a break, or people who get completely laid off of the company, right? So it's up to you to decide how do you want to customize that.
HM

Harrison McKee
1 minuto 37 segundos1:37
Harrison McKee 1 minuto 37 segundos
Awesome, awesome. OK, the couple things I wanted to figure out, which I know we talked about it early on and forget if it was in one of the emails that I overlooked. Are we still trying to figure out a workaround to pull from red team to get our projects to line up in here?

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 47 segundos1:47
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 47 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 56 segundos
Yes. So to be honest, I haven't put a lot of effort into it, but it's gonna require something different because we don't have access to the to their API documentation, so it's not a simple solution. If they actually provided that, it will be just a matter of connecting.
BT
Brett Tatum
2 minutos 15 segundos2:15
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 15 segundos
Can I can I jump in here real quick and offer a suggestion? So Harrison, I would say this depends on how important it is to you to have. Let me let me share my screen real quick and we'll jump back to yours.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
2 minutos 15 segundos2:15
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 15 segundos
Endpoints, yeah.
HM
Harrison McKee
2 minutos 23 segundos2:23
Harrison McKee 2 minutos 23 segundos
Yep.
BT
Brett Tatum
2 minutos 29 segundos2:29
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 29 segundos
So Harrison, this is in red team.
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 33 segundos
And you have a view. You have a option to download to Excel.
HM
Harrison McKee
2 minutos 40 segundos2:40
Harrison McKee 2 minutos 40 segundos
OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
2 minutos 41 segundos2:41
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 41 segundos
Like a project list. So what we could do totally up to you, but we could probably make an we could make an uploader or you would have to do it manually.
HM
Harrison McKee
2 minutos 47 segundos2:47
Harrison McKee 2 minutos 47 segundos
Is like pivot and drop that in.
Harrison McKee 2 minutos 53 segundos
Yep.
BT
Brett Tatum
2 minutos 54 segundos2:54
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 54 segundos
But Mateo could write an upload feature where you can just take this report, upload it, and then you would have the.
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 4 segundos
Your roject list directly from red team.
Harrison McKee
3 minutos 6 segundos3:06
Harrison McKee 3 minutos 6 segundos
That that's great. My only question for Mateo, if we did that, is there a way to do it to where like it won't duplicate itself? Like is there a way to lock that?
Harrison McKee 3 minutos 13 segundos
Mhm.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 19 segundos3:19
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 19 segundos
Yeah, absolutely.
HM
Harrison McKee
3 minutos 21 segundos3:21
Harrison McKee 3 minutos 21 segundos
Like where? I guess my point is that if on the.
Harrison McKee 3 minutos 25 segundos
If I notice some jobs are missing, but I don't know what jobs are missing, she can download that whole list, drop it in, but we're not gonna have four of the same jobs after doing that four times.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 29 segundos3:29
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 29 segundos
Yeah, it's cool.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 34 segundos
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Don't worry. I'll completely make sure, make sure that we have some sort of project validation. Exactly.
BT
Brett Tatum
3 minutos 41 segundos3:41
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 41 segundos
You've got a unique identifier. Yeah, you got a unique identifier here, so we'll just you. You can set up the the upload where it doesn't duplicate something that already exists.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 51 segundos3:51
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 51 segundos
Yeah.
HM
Harrison McKee
3 minutos 51 segundos3:51
Harrison McKee 3 minutos 51 segundos
Sweet. OK, that that's good. I'm fine with like trying to make a manually update like just do it when we create jobs moving forward. The the bigger question I had was like, I mean Brett, you know better than anybody you get.
BT
Brett Tatum
3 minutos 52 segundos3:52
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 52 segundos
OK.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 53 segundos3:53
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 53 segundos
It's not going to be an issue for you.
BT
Brett Tatum
4 minutos 3 segundos4:03
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 3 segundos
Yeah.
HM
Harrison McKee
4 minutos 8 segundos4:08
Harrison McKee 4 minutos 8 segundos
Distracted or down the road and you're like, man, there's two or three jobs or I don't know how many other jobs are in here and you want them all put over.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
4 minutos 17 segundos4:17
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 17 segundos
Yeah, don't worry, that's not gonna happen to you. So the only thing that I will ask from you guys, please send me that list that you just found out so I know which fields I'm going to be uploading to to this project to the crew tracker.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 33 segundos
And then based on that, I'll create something that whenever you import all of the projects, you will never have a duplicate 1.
BT
Brett Tatum
4 minutos 40 segundos4:40
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 40 segundos
Let me I wanted to look at one thing real quick here like on this report I think what I have to do is add the columns so like it would be important to have the address like work location. So there we go cause you want that to pull through.
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 51 segundos
Yes.
HM
Harrison McKee
4 minutos 57 segundos4:57
Harrison McKee 4 minutos 57 segundos
Yes.
Harrison McKee 5 minutos 2 segundos
Here's some projects and under OK, I know where you're at.
BT
Brett Tatum
5 minutos 5 segundos5:05
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 5 segundos
Yeah, OK, that add more location. So Harrison, I think what what you would need to do, I think it makes more sense for you to do this is here in your red team on your projects tab, go through and get your columns set up with everything that you want.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
5 minutos 6 segundos5:06
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 6 segundos
And.
HM
Harrison McKee
5 minutos 14 segundos5:14
Harrison McKee 5 minutos 14 segundos
Yeah.
Harrison McKee 5 minutos 20 segundos
Yeah.
Harrison McKee 5 minutos 24 segundos
To show in this.
Brett Tatum
5 minutos 25 segundos5:25
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 25 segundos
To pull through, yeah, 'cause then that'll then. So then go, you know, view Excel and why don't you send the Excel file to Mateo?
HM
Harrison McKee
5 minutos 27 segundos5:27
Harrison McKee 5 minutos 27 segundos
I got you.
Harrison McKee 5 minutos 37 segundos
Absolutely.
BT
Brett Tatum
5 minutos 38 segundos5:38
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 38 segundos
So that way it's got the columns that you want like and only the columns that you want.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
5 minutos 42 segundos5:42
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 42 segundos
Um.
HM
Harrison McKee
5 minutos 45 segundos5:45
Harrison McKee 5 minutos 45 segundos
Absolutely. Yeah, it'll work.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
5 minutos 45 segundos5:45
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 45 segundos
And then a follow up question for Harrison. The columns, I mean the Excel file with all of the columns you will send me are all of those columns. Do you need them on the crew tracker? I guess yes, right?
HM
Harrison McKee
6 minutos6:00
Harrison McKee 6 minutos
Yes, I'll select the ones that matter. I'll probably take customer off more than likely. I don't.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 8 segundos6:08
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 8 segundos
That's good because in the in the jobs tab I only have like 3, three or four fields available.
BT
Brett Tatum
6 minutos 13 segundos6:13
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 13 segundos
Fields. Yeah. So you'll you'll get more. Yeah, there'll never be a couple more, right. So you're saying.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 17 segundos6:17
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 17 segundos
Mhm.
HM
Harrison McKee
6 minutos 18 segundos6:18
Harrison McKee 6 minutos 18 segundos
There might be a couple more, like it might have a project number. It might have, you know, a project number name.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 18 segundos6:18
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 18 segundos
Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 21 segundos
Yeah, yeah, some.
BT
Brett Tatum
6 minutos 27 segundos6:27
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 27 segundos
Maybe the manager? I don't know. Do you care about that?
HM
Harrison McKee
6 minutos 31 segundos6:31
Harrison McKee 6 minutos 31 segundos
No, not really. Because the crew's gonna the crew's manager is Jose. The crew's gonna go to Jose for everything.
BT
Brett Tatum
6 minutos 32 segundos6:32
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 32 segundos
Status sub status division market.
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 38 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 39 segundos
So it might just be 3 columns here, Harrison. I mean in all honesty, project name, project number, project name and work location. Oh, you want this?
HM
Harrison McKee
6 minutos 42 segundos6:42
Harrison McKee 6 minutos 42 segundos
Work location name and project number.
Harrison McKee 6 minutos 47 segundos
And then the status, whether it's active.
BT
Brett Tatum
6 minutos 51 segundos6:51
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 51 segundos
Status. OK, fair enough. So in progress proposal, that's probably helpful.
HM
Harrison McKee
6 minutos 57 segundos6:57
Harrison McKee 6 minutos 57 segundos
Now that that kind of segues me. I'm gonna rub the screen back, Brett. That kind of segues me back into what I was gonna talk about with the projects. I know you have a search bar here, but is there a way to make them?

Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 57 segundos6:57
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 57 segundos
Awesome.
BT
Brett Tatum
7 minutos7:00
Brett Tatum 7 minutos
Yep, you're good.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 8 segundos7:08
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 8 segundos
Yeah.
HM
Harrison McKee
7 minutos 12 segundos7:12
Harrison McKee 7 minutos 12 segundos
Similar ready this is no it's just up and up. Is there a way to make it similar to an Excel document where like I could filter and see only the actives or only the inactives or?

Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 25 segundos7:25
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 25 segundos
Yeah, of course I'll add them. I just. I haven't added any filters at the moment, but yeah, any absolutely any filters you need, you want, I can create them for you.
HM
Harrison McKee
7 minutos 26 segundos7:26
Harrison McKee 7 minutos 26 segundos
So on and so forth.
Harrison McKee 7 minutos 33 segundos
What my goal here to do is as we get into Brett I'll appreciate like the question, but as we get into this this job, if I want to say, hey, who did the door installation on the 2nd floor because we're having problems with the door.
Harrison McKee 7 minutos 50 segundos
I wanna be able to kinda like click into this job, see all of the work orders within that job.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 50 segundos7:50
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 50 segundos
Oh.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 55 segundos
Hmm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 56 segundos
Yep, it's going to be fairly easy. I'll show you. I already have something built in for that. Click on the I icon under actions.
HM
Harrison McKee
7 minutos 57 segundos7:57
Harrison McKee 7 minutos 57 segundos
And then?
Harrison McKee 8 minutos 5 segundos
Yep.
BT
Brett Tatum
8 minutos 6 segundos8:06
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 6 segundos
Yep.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 9 segundos8:09
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 9 segundos
That'll load just a second. Click on updates.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 13 segundos
So over here you're going to be able to track every single people, every single person who has touched these projects. So for example, the idea is as soon as you start sending SMS, you'll be able to see under activity timeline what the job was done by who it was done, right? And it's automated, so you're not even going to have to.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 33 segundos
Touch.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 35 segundos
That at all. You'll be able to see at all times the date and the timestamp of when a project was started and by who it was done right. You can also enter manual updates, so they're in the add new update. You can add details to that specific job to whatever you want. You can even try it right now if you want to, so that way you have.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 55 segundos
Somewhat. Some control onto what was done, how it was done. Um, yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 2 segundos
So.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 4 segundos
Give it a try.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 16 segundos
There you go, you have it and then you have also activity timeline.
BT
Brett Tatum
9 minutos 21 segundos9:21
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 21 segundos
Now Mateo, will this pull directly from the tracker like from your?
HM
Harrison McKee
9 minutos 21 segundos9:21
Harrison McKee 9 minutos 21 segundos
The the he said.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
9 minutos 29 segundos9:29
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 29 segundos
Yeah, it will pull.
BT
Brett Tatum
9 minutos 29 segundos9:29
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 29 segundos
Like they don't wanna go into a project every day and put in an update.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
9 minutos 33 segundos9:33
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 33 segundos
Yeah, of course, of course. No, it will pull out of this. Everything's already wired up. It's not showing at the moment because the messages aren't sending. It's getting stuck in Twilo. But again, it's because of the the campaign that hasn't been approved, but as soon as the that.
HM
Harrison McKee
9 minutos 34 segundos9:34
Harrison McKee 9 minutos 34 segundos
The piece that I'm broken with.
Harrison McKee 10 minutos 9 segundos
Yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 10 segundos10:10
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 10 segundos
Does that help or would you like more functionality to these?
HM
Harrison McKee
10 minutos 10 segundos10:10
Harrison McKee 10 minutos 10 segundos
OK, Ed.
Harrison McKee 10 minutos 14 segundos
This this helps like this is definitely good at a quick glance and what I'd say is probably on short durations of jobs. This is fine. This will be enough for a tacco paint the door situation where I'm looking for more of a.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 22 segundos10:22
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 22 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 26 segundos
Mm-hmm.
BT
Brett Tatum
10 minutos 27 segundos10:27
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 27 segundos
Yep.
HM
Harrison McKee
10 minutos 30 segundos10:30
Harrison McKee 10 minutos 30 segundos
In depth is some of our jobs are two or three days long. Some of our jobs will be operating under that same job at the same address for nine months. So whenever we go into a job like that and there's 75 doors, but I'm trying to figure out who installed one.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 34 segundos10:34
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 34 segundos
Oh.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 38 segundos
OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
10 minutos 39 segundos10:39
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 39 segundos
Yep.
HM
Harrison McKee
10 minutos 46 segundos10:46
Harrison McKee 10 minutos 46 segundos
You know what I mean. I'm wanting to figure out how I can, how I can go back to search that task per say.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 46 segundos10:46
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 46 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 54 segundos
OK.
HM
Harrison McKee
10 minutos 54 segundos10:54
Harrison McKee 10 minutos 54 segundos
How I can go back to kind of search that task cause that same job might be called, you know, Mateo's school and there's the address. But in the school we're doing all the insulation, all the drywall, all the doors, all the ceilings. So there's hundreds of.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
11 minutos 1 segundo11:01
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 1 segundo
Mhm.
HM
Harrison McKee
11 minutos 10 segundos11:10
Harrison McKee 11 minutos 10 segundos
There's hundreds of little scheduled work tasks that get built up. How can I search? How can I search just under the scheduled work tasks? Or how can I search under?
Mateo Roldan Taborda
11 minutos 16 segundos11:16
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 16 segundos
Or the same job.
BT
Brett Tatum
11 minutos 24 segundos11:24
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 24 segundos
I.
HM
Harrison McKee
11 minutos 25 segundos11:25
Harrison McKee 11 minutos 25 segundos
That that's part of it. How can I search under the schedule work tasks to go back and look up? Hey, when did we, when did we first go out there and start putting indoors?
BT
Brett Tatum
11 minutos 34 segundos11:34
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 34 segundos
Can I make a recommendation here? So when you're in jobs, so here's a click back on jobs.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
11 minutos 34 segundos11:34
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 34 segundos
Um.
HM
Harrison McKee
11 minutos 37 segundos11:37
Harrison McKee 11 minutos 37 segundos
Yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
11 minutos 42 segundos11:42
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 42 segundos
And then go to your eyeball. So this job is going to accumulate, you know, it's a long job like that, like hundreds of updates, right? Because you're going to have multiple guys there on multiple days over the course of a year. Can we just get like an Excel export for this page? Because then what you could do is you could use Excel.
HM
Harrison McKee
11 minutos 52 segundos11:52
Harrison McKee 11 minutos 52 segundos
Yes.
BT
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 2 segundos12:02
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 2 segundos
Like use the search fields, filter it, sort it so you can see like OK, they're doing 2nd floor doors over this week and yeah, so as opposed to trying to making like an integrated robust search feature, to me it feels easier just to export it.
HM
Harrison McKee
12 minutos 11 segundos12:11
Harrison McKee 12 minutos 11 segundos
On this day, yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 20 segundos12:20
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 20 segundos
Because you're not going to be doing that that often before you're diving back into a job.
HM
Harrison McKee
12 minutos 23 segundos12:23
Harrison McKee 12 minutos 23 segundos
No, we're not gonna do it that that often. So at least as long as we have the capability to go pull something decently quick and then dive into it. But yes, you get the the gist of it is, is this is gonna look like a 300 e-mail chain.
BT
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 26 segundos12:26
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 26 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 40 segundos
Yep, Yep.
HM
Harrison McKee
12 minutos 40 segundos12:40
Harrison McKee 12 minutos 40 segundos
And and it's like searching the e-mail box trying to figure out what you did when and short of just reading every little one. How can we help with that? The other the other feature I had is whenever we get into.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos 40 segundos12:40
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 40 segundos
Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 45 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 50 segundos
Absolutely.
HM
Harrison McKee
12 minutos 55 segundos12:55
Harrison McKee 12 minutos 55 segundos
This page I know that we could pull time from going to this and kind of go back to whatever day you had time in. Mateo had 10 hours in at this job site with this cost code.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 5 segundos13:05
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 5 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 10 segundos
Hello.
HM
Harrison McKee
13 minutos 11 segundos13:11
Harrison McKee 13 minutos 11 segundos
Is there a way that we under this tab I could like pull up everywhere Mateo's been?
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 20 segundos13:20
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 20 segundos
So like if you the eyeball on Mateo would give you all of his activity.
HM
Harrison McKee
13 minutos 24 segundos13:24
Harrison McKee 13 minutos 24 segundos
Yeah, like, can I look at this and see? OK, Mateo was at the school this day. He was at the office this day. He was at this this day.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 31 segundos13:31
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 31 segundos
I done.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 33 segundos13:33
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 33 segundos
Yeah, definitely. I'll add that. That's kind of like what the message history is going to be. It's kind of like a detailed view of like the things that you've done specifically for the employee. So maybe that that'll help.
HM
Harrison McKee
13 minutos 39 segundos13:39
Harrison McKee 13 minutos 39 segundos
OK.
Harrison McKee 13 minutos 48 segundos
Yeah, my yeah, my thought is where we could use this. The whole purpose of kind of these boxes within the tracker is this, you know, they pick which crew member goes where once the job gets completed. All right, well, we can run a little test, but how it goes out to the guys.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 55 segundos13:55
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 55 segundos
Hmm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos
Yeah.
HM
Harrison McKee
14 minutos 8 segundos14:08
Harrison McKee 14 minutos 8 segundos
Would be.
Harrison McKee 14 minutos 10 segundos
Install 30 sheets of drywall.
Harrison McKee 14 minutos 17 segundos
At that point, it would go out to Chase, right? And Chase would do his job.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 22 segundos14:22
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 22 segundos
Mhm.
HM
Harrison McKee
14 minutos 23 segundos14:23
Harrison McKee 14 minutos 23 segundos
How it follows back up is our office help. Matea has to put Chase's time for that drywall install into our payroll software. But whenever she puts the payroll time, she doesn't know how many hours because it hasn't worked yet.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 36 segundos14:36
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 36 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 40 segundos
Mhm.
HM
Harrison McKee
14 minutos 41 segundos14:41
Harrison McKee 14 minutos 41 segundos
So it's like a circle back that Jose can come in and put 10 hours. Jamie, our project manager can tell her what bucket it needs to go to.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 45 segundos14:45
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 45 segundos
I see so.
HM
Harrison McKee
14 minutos 55 segundos14:55
Harrison McKee 14 minutos 55 segundos
And then she can code it.

14 minutos 57 segundos14:57
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 57 segundos
Yeah, absolutely. So how does this work? So as soon as you click on save schedule over here, whenever you have everything kind of like set up for for the people like you will create the kind of like the timestamp with all of the details including cost code, worked hours, the place that they went to.
HM
Harrison McKee
15 minutos 4 segundos15:04
Harrison McKee 15 minutos 4 segundos
Yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
15 minutos 16 segundos15:16
Mateo Roldan Taborda 15 minutos 16 segundos
And everything but inside of the profile for each employee. That way you can also I'll create the the same function to export into an Excel those details for each employee. So you will know at what time, when and or whatever time the people worked at certain.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 15 minutos 35 segundos
Place, right? So if, for example, you had a guy who worked over a month, you'll be able to see like the the cumulative number of hours they actually worked. So you can just place all of that information right away into your payroll software that works.
HM
Harrison McKee
15 minutos 51 segundos15:51
Harrison McKee 15 minutos 51 segundos
Yeah, that works.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
15 minutos 53 segundos15:53
Mateo Roldan Taborda 15 minutos 53 segundos
Awesome.
HM
Harrison McKee
15 minutos 54 segundos15:54
Harrison McKee 15 minutos 54 segundos
This box here the added tasks.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
16 minutos16:00
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos
Mhm.
HM
Harrison McKee
16 minutos 1 segundo16:01
Harrison McKee 16 minutos 1 segundo
Is not going to be filled out by any sort of our project management team. It's going to be more from like the crew in the field.
Harrison McKee 16 minutos 10 segundos
This is the crew in the field box to basically tell me what changed throughout your day. If I sent you out there to the drywall and they show up, they could put a message, you know, Brett.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
16 minutos 16 segundos16:16
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 16 segundos
OK.
HM
Harrison McKee
16 minutos 23 segundos16:23
Harrison McKee 16 minutos 23 segundos
Moved us to installing doors.
Harrison McKee 16 minutos 29 segundos
That's sometimes going to result in US triggering to a change order. There's a lot of times it's going to just trigger like us shifting the buckets of the cost code. There might be a different cost code for drywall versus.
Harrison McKee 16 minutos 44 segundos
The doors.
Harrison McKee 16 minutos 46 segundos
So it's like the the day kind of changed. The same guy's still at the same location, but his tasks flipped around.
Harrison McKee 16 minutos 54 segundos
Is there a way that that doesn't just get kind of lost in the sauce throughout it? And what I mean by that is, is there a way that when this box goes?
Harrison McKee 17 minutos 4 segundos
It filters it to a yellow or a something or sends a project manager or an e-mail or but my fear is that this gets changed.
Harrison McKee 17 minutos 16 segundos
Jamie's out of the office for the afternoon, comes in the next day and kind of never figures out that Brett moved the guys to doors, short of like verbals or he misses a change order over time for it, so on so forth. Like I I think they're it leaves you a vulnerable gap.
Harrison McKee 17 minutos 35 segundos
By not necessarily having like a circle back.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
17 minutos 39 segundos17:39
Mateo Roldan Taborda 17 minutos 39 segundos
Interesting. Um.
HM
Harrison McKee
17 minutos 42 segundos17:42
Harrison McKee 17 minutos 42 segundos
My my thought would be like if anything gets typed into this, there's a little box that says PM approval and that has to get checked and until that box gets checked it's sitting in an Excel export or something under added tasks that aren't approved.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
17 minutos 59 segundos17:59
Mateo Roldan Taborda 17 minutos 59 segundos
Um.
HM
Harrison McKee
18 minutos 2 segundos18:02
Harrison McKee 18 minutos 2 segundos
So more than anything, either Jamie, I, Sam, Alex, whoever's kind of sitting in that PM role would have to jump in here. One of us. I'm not saying make it critical to who checks that box. I don't think it needs to be that in depth.
Harrison McKee 18 minutos 17 segundos
But it needs to be.
Harrison McKee 18 minutos 20 segundos
Kind of sitting here screaming at you like an unread e-mail until you acknowledged it that it happened.
BT
Brett Tatum
18 minutos 27 segundos18:27
Brett Tatum 18 minutos 27 segundos
So can I ask a couple questions here guys, just to make sure we're all on the same page. So this added tasks only gets filled in by a reply text message from the field. So like no OK, this gets added by who?
HM
Harrison McKee
18 minutos 39 segundos18:39
Harrison McKee 18 minutos 39 segundos
No. No.
BT
Brett Tatum
18 minutos 43 segundos18:43
Brett Tatum 18 minutos 43 segundos
Camilla. OK, so she's adding this in there.
HM
Harrison McKee
18 minutos 44 segundos18:44
Harrison McKee 18 minutos 44 segundos
Yeah, yeah, Camilla, I mean, if it could come from the added text message, I think that I think the less our guys are on their phone short of just direct information, the better. I more or less think of this for, hey, we sent them out to drywall right now. Me and you are having a financial meeting. Jose is.
BT
Brett Tatum
18 minutos 49 segundos18:49
Brett Tatum 18 minutos 49 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 18 minutos 56 segundos
Yeah.
HM
Harrison McKee
19 minutos 4 segundos19:04
Harrison McKee 19 minutos 4 segundos
Out at Love's with Jake and Jake moves them and says, hey, don't drywall anymore. We're going to start putting in all the doors on the office side. Well, that's fine. It's still in our contract. But like, I need to know that so that I can change schedules and plans and so on and so forth. So it's not necessarily a money change in that situation.
BT
Brett Tatum
19 minutos 11 segundos19:11
Brett Tatum 19 minutos 11 segundos
Yeah.
HM
Harrison McKee
19 minutos 22 segundos19:22
Harrison McKee 19 minutos 22 segundos
But I need to at least be aware as the project management team, hey, something to change and this triggers me to call Jose, talk to Jose about it, vice versa, like just track it.
BT
Brett Tatum
19 minutos 34 segundos19:34
Brett Tatum 19 minutos 34 segundos
So I was gonna so say maybe it can work right in here like you were saying where it's like once something gets added in here there's some sort of like button that comes up that you have to approve. But what I was almost thinking is should like on our top ribbon we have employees, job schedule messages.
Brett Tatum 19 minutos 51 segundos
Should we have kind of call it schedule exceptions or approvals? And it's a list of like it's pulling from this and saying, hey, if there's a field, you know something's been added in here, it needs to go on another list.
HM
Harrison McKee
19 minutos 53 segundos19:53
Harrison McKee 19 minutos 53 segundos
Edit tasks.
BT
Brett Tatum
20 minutos 3 segundos20:03
Brett Tatum 20 minutos 3 segundos
And the project managers noted to review that list each day.
HM
Harrison McKee
20 minutos 3 segundos20:03
Harrison McKee 20 minutos 3 segundos
Yeah.
Harrison McKee 20 minutos 6 segundos
Yeah, I think like, I think that.
Harrison McKee 20 minutos 7 segundos
Yeah.
Harrison McKee 20 minutos 13 segundos
I think that and then some way of like just what I'm trying to. I'm trying not to create a workflow per SE because I don't want to impede somebody else from doing their job because it's locked up on my desk.
Harrison McKee 20 minutos 28 segundos
You with me like if Mateo wants to put in time, I want her to put in time without having it locked up and she can't see it. But what I would like to do is if this says you know if this was, if this wasn't changed, I said about to do drywall and.
BT
Brett Tatum
20 minutos 32 segundos20:32
Brett Tatum 20 minutos 32 segundos
Yeah.
HM
Harrison McKee
20 minutos 46 segundos20:46
Harrison McKee 20 minutos 46 segundos
They were whatever. Jake Bogner was gonna send the crew home but said, hey, sweep the parking lot since we're already gonna eat the time.
BT
Brett Tatum
20 minutos 55 segundos20:55
Brett Tatum 20 minutos 55 segundos
Yeah.
HM
Harrison McKee
20 minutos 56 segundos20:56
Harrison McKee 20 minutos 56 segundos
I want that here and not lost. So that way at the end of today or if I'm on a two day vacation or whatever, when I come back I can circle back to what changed. What do we need to follow up on?
BT
Brett Tatum
21 minutos 12 segundos21:12
Brett Tatum 21 minutos 12 segundos
See, Harrison, I like the idea of like an exceptions.
Brett Tatum 21 minutos 16 segundos
List and what it would be is anything that gets added to this field goes to the exception list and it has like a, you know, an approve or a clear something that like if Sam's going through it, he can say, oh that's my job, OK, they, you know, they moved him to doors and he can go, he can go.
HM
Harrison McKee
21 minutos 25 segundos21:25
Harrison McKee 21 minutos 25 segundos
Yep.
Harrison McKee 21 minutos 29 segundos
Yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
21 minutos 35 segundos21:35
Brett Tatum 21 minutos 35 segundos
Basically he's just clearing it. You just want a list for then he's seeing it and he goes, alright, clear that's taken care of, you know. Then it's the next one to Jamie's job and he can hit clear and it's just a running list like it it pulls from.
HM
Harrison McKee
21 minutos 37 segundos21:37
Harrison McKee 21 minutos 37 segundos
Yeah.
Harrison McKee 21 minutos 40 segundos
Yeah.
Harrison McKee 21 minutos 43 segundos
Yep.
Harrison McKee 21 minutos 47 segundos
Yep.
BT
Brett Tatum
21 minutos 48 segundos21:48
Brett Tatum 21 minutos 48 segundos
Previous days, current day, as things get added, it kinda pops in there in real time, you know?
Harrison McKee
21 minutos 54 segundos21:54
Harrison McKee 21 minutos 54 segundos
Yeah, and even when you clear it, it doesn't necessarily clear that task box, Mateo. It just gets it off of that running list.
BT
Brett Tatum
21 minutos 57 segundos21:57
Brett Tatum 21 minutos 57 segundos
No.
Brett Tatum 22 minutos 2 segundos
So, so I think we could use Mateo. Mateo, you you repeat, you repeat. Let's start. OK, let's see if we can slow it down here. So.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
22 minutos 3 segundos22:03
Mateo Roldan Taborda 22 minutos 3 segundos
Sounds good. Yeah, a little bit.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 22 minutos 11 segundos
Yeah, I got a little bit confused over there, so.
BT
Brett Tatum
22 minutos 12 segundos22:12
Brett Tatum 22 minutos 12 segundos
Someone inside the office? Yeah, that's right. So someone in the office, just like Harrison typed in here under added tasks, he typed. Brett moved us to installing doors. Well, when someone's adding something to this added tasks, and maybe that's not the right title for it, but right now that's what it is. So it's added tasks.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
22 minutos 19 segundos22:19
Mateo Roldan Taborda 22 minutos 19 segundos
OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 22 minutos 22 segundos
Yes.
BT
Brett Tatum
22 minutos 31 segundos22:31
Brett Tatum 22 minutos 31 segundos
What this is is something has happened out in the on the construction site that deviated from the scheduled task.
HM
Harrison McKee
22 minutos 38 segundos22:38
Harrison McKee 22 minutos 38 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
22 minutos 40 segundos22:40
Brett Tatum 22 minutos 40 segundos
Well, what Harrison wants to make sure is that when we have deviations from what was scheduled, that his team, his project managers are reviewing those deviations.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
22 minutos 52 segundos22:52
Mateo Roldan Taborda 22 minutos 52 segundos
Uh, so you want some sort of validation that people actually saw it and confirmed it. So OK, it's much more clear.
BT
Brett Tatum
22 minutos 57 segundos22:57
Brett Tatum 22 minutos 57 segundos
Yes. So what? What I think makes sense is what I think makes sense is that once you have a deviation. So essentially once anything gets typed into one of these boxes, that deviation goes to a like a deviations list or a.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
23 minutos 6 segundos23:06
Mateo Roldan Taborda 23 minutos 6 segundos
OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
23 minutos 13 segundos23:13
Brett Tatum 23 minutos 13 segundos
You know, somewhere where then a project manager kind of from a validation standpoint has to like, OK, I see that deviation and they can like clear it and remove it from the list because there's various right Harrison, there's there's there's a dozen different things they could do with that deviation from nothing needs to be done to.
HM
Harrison McKee
23 minutos 31 segundos23:31
Harrison McKee 23 minutos 31 segundos
Yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
23 minutos 33 segundos23:33
Brett Tatum 23 minutos 33 segundos
OK, I need to send a owner change order with pricing, you know what I mean? But I don't think you wanna go that far down like the validation you're not asking me to tell you.
HM
Harrison McKee
23 minutos 37 segundos23:37
Harrison McKee 23 minutos 37 segundos
Yeah.
Harrison McKee 23 minutos 39 segundos
No, I I'm not trying to like, I'm not trying to create this to be red team as much as just like the information passer.
BT
Brett Tatum
23 minutos 47 segundos23:47
Brett Tatum 23 minutos 47 segundos
Yep.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
23 minutos 48 segundos23:48
Mateo Roldan Taborda 23 minutos 48 segundos
Something I can do for you guys over here now that I fully understood is that as soon as you add something into that column, you'll get kind of like a little button within the text area saying acknowledge right? As soon as you acknowledge it, it will change colors and it will take all of that information from all of that row into a different list.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 24 minutos 8 segundos
And then as soon as it's on that list, the only way to take it away from that list is to approve the change until you know that everything added to that task is completed or taken action. Make sense.
BT
Brett Tatum
24 minutos 18 segundos24:18
Brett Tatum 24 minutos 18 segundos
Yeah.
HM
Harrison McKee
24 minutos 22 segundos24:22
Harrison McKee 24 minutos 22 segundos
Yeah, the only thing I was trying to do, like make sure is understood is what if you have the deviation list or whatever you want to call it, change of plans on site, whatever it may be, whenever that gets reviewed at the PM level.
Harrison McKee 24 minutos 40 segundos
Project managers level and they say OK, I acknowledge that Brett moved them to installing doors. I I do not want this to disappear off of.
Harrison McKee 24 minutos 51 segundos
This page. I want this to remain here for constant review.
BT
Brett Tatum
24 minutos 52 segundos24:52
Brett Tatum 24 minutos 52 segundos
Yeah.
HM
Harrison McKee
24 minutos 52 segundos24:52
Harrison McKee 24 minutos 52 segundos
Hey, I will.
BT
Brett Tatum
24 minutos 56 segundos24:56
Brett Tatum 24 minutos 56 segundos
Yep.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
24 minutos 56 segundos24:56
Mateo Roldan Taborda 24 minutos 56 segundos
Yeah, absolutely. You will get a validation over. There's like probably a red box or kind of like an X or a check mark until somebody actually validates it. There will be a small button within the text area saying hey, validated or changed or whatever phrasing we choose.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 25 minutos 14 segundos
Until that is checked, that it's not gonna stop bugging you for for whoever's going to be reviewing that.
HM
Harrison McKee
25 minutos 21 segundos25:21
Harrison McKee 25 minutos 21 segundos
Yep. OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
25 minutos 22 segundos25:22
Brett Tatum 25 minutos 22 segundos
Harrison, I would say the same thing. I would my thought would be is anytime you have something that added tasks for sure, but also if anyone puts any notes in or tasks not completed, I think if anything gets filled in your those three boxes, I think that should go in the deviations list.
Harrison McKee
25 minutos 31 segundos25:31
Harrison McKee 25 minutos 31 segundos
Yeah.
Harrison McKee 25 minutos 35 segundos
Yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
25 minutos 38 segundos25:38
Mateo Roldan Taborda 25 minutos 38 segundos
Sounds good.
HM
Harrison McKee
25 minutos 40 segundos25:40
Harrison McKee 25 minutos 40 segundos
I I'm curious if we can make different lists ping, whether it's different titles or do we just select the users that it pings. And the reason I say that is like Jamie will put in here. Jamie and I will fill this out materials needed and Brett for what it's worth, this will save you know.
Harrison McKee 25 minutos 59 segundos
Let's say it's Chase. Swing by the shop and grab the trailer. The drywalls on the trailer. Well, I don't need that to sit in Jamie's approval box. I don't need that to sit in Sam's approval box. The only one that needs to make sure she sees that is Camilla and Jose.
BT
Brett Tatum
26 minutos 2 segundos26:02
Brett Tatum 26 minutos 2 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 26 minutos 8 segundos
Oh.
HM
Harrison McKee
26 minutos 14 segundos26:14
Harrison McKee 26 minutos 14 segundos
This whole column is me telling Camilla and Jose. Make sure your guys are aware of this and it will be included on the text to the guy, so I don't know if it necessarily needs to be reviewed by them.
BT
Brett Tatum
26 minutos 22 segundos26:22
Brett Tatum 26 minutos 22 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 26 minutos 27 segundos
I would argue in this case that you don't.
Brett Tatum 26 minutos 33 segundos
They can also like Jose and Camila are gonna live on this schedule page in my mind like they're gonna this is where they're gonna be reviewing. So I would say a separate list for them probably isn't necessary because that's kind of more of like active current day. I like the list kind of the exceptions list for that's like a review that's like a look back.
HM
Harrison McKee
26 minutos 37 segundos26:37
Harrison McKee 26 minutos 37 segundos
Yeah.
Harrison McKee 26 minutos 45 segundos
Yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
26 minutos 52 segundos26:52
Brett Tatum 26 minutos 52 segundos
Back at the prior day. So that's kind of how I would think about it is like, hey, they, Camilla and Jose are living in this sheet like we don't need to create separate views for them.
HM
Harrison McKee
26 minutos 53 segundos26:53
Harrison McKee 26 minutos 53 segundos
Yeah.
Harrison McKee 27 minutos 3 segundos
Yep.
BT
Brett Tatum
27 minutos 4 segundos27:04
Brett Tatum 27 minutos 4 segundos
Um.
Brett Tatum 27 minutos 7 segundos
You know, one thing that may be nice, just like you've done in other modules, Mateo is on this daily crew schedule is showing and having the ability to show and collapse certain columns. So that way like Jose comes in here, he's like, man, I don't care about cost code, I don't care about W2 hours, he's like.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
27 minutos 12 segundos27:12
Mateo Roldan Taborda 27 minutos 12 segundos
It.
BT
Brett Tatum
27 minutos 26 segundos27:26
Brett Tatum 27 minutos 26 segundos
I just need to see.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
27 minutos 27 segundos27:27
Mateo Roldan Taborda 27 minutos 27 segundos
Absolutely. I'll create the filters for the columns as well, so you'll be able to remove them, add them and customize them to however you want it.
BT
Brett Tatum
27 minutos 28 segundos27:28
Brett Tatum 27 minutos 28 segundos
Four different columns.
Brett Tatum 27 minutos 35 segundos
And Camilla may need all of them. Harrison, you may need two or three. So that way maybe this view can be a little bit more customizable.
HM
Harrison McKee
27 minutos 35 segundos27:35
Harrison McKee 27 minutos 35 segundos
Yep.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
27 minutos 37 segundos27:37
Mateo Roldan Taborda 27 minutos 37 segundos
Yeah, exactly.
HM
Harrison McKee
27 minutos 38 segundos27:38
Harrison McKee 27 minutos 38 segundos
Yeah.
Harrison McKee 27 minutos 43 segundos
Yep, I like that.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
27 minutos 44 segundos27:44
Mateo Roldan Taborda 27 minutos 44 segundos
There's a few things over here that I would like to show you, and the most important one on the 2nd row click on job.
BT
Brett Tatum
27 minutos 46 segundos27:46
Brett Tatum 27 minutos 46 segundos
OK.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
27 minutos 53 segundos27:53
Mateo Roldan Taborda 27 minutos 53 segundos
And add again, no on the 2nd row. Sorry, click again on drywall installation. So now they both merge. So because I took a I took a quick glance into the sheet you guys shared with me and I saw that.
BT
Brett Tatum
28 minutos 2 segundos28:02
Brett Tatum 28 minutos 2 segundos
Yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
28 minutos 10 segundos28:10
Mateo Roldan Taborda 28 minutos 10 segundos
There's probably 10 people going into the same job, right? So that way you'll send the same information to all of the people with like you'll be able to customize, of course, later on if everybody has a different tasks, you'll kind of like be able to merge rows.
HM
Harrison McKee
28 minutos 12 segundos28:12
Harrison McKee 28 minutos 12 segundos
Yep.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
28 minutos 27 segundos28:27
Mateo Roldan Taborda 28 minutos 27 segundos
By the job. Is that something?
BT
Brett Tatum
28 minutos 28 segundos28:28
Brett Tatum 28 minutos 28 segundos
How does it work right now if like the scheduled task? Let's say you got two guys, but they got different tasks. How do you split up the tasks?
HM
Harrison McKee
28 minutos 28 segundos28:28
Harrison McKee 28 minutos 28 segundos
Yeah, then.
Harrison McKee 28 minutos 35 segundos
How it works currently in our Excel is.
Harrison McKee 28 minutos 39 segundos
We would not. We might combine the address, but we'd leave the task split. But I mean that because it's Excel, it's easy enough to change back and forth on the fly. We might have eight guys to go on a job site and six of them are doing interior framing and drywall and two are doing exterior power washing.
BT
Brett Tatum
28 minutos 45 segundos28:45
Brett Tatum 28 minutos 45 segundos
Yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
28 minutos 47 segundos28:47
Mateo Roldan Taborda 28 minutos 47 segundos
Mhm.
HM
Harrison McKee
28 minutos 59 segundos28:59
Harrison McKee 28 minutos 59 segundos
So we'll split it up where six work together and two work together, but they both work at the same job site, same address.
BT
Brett Tatum
29 minutos 7 segundos29:07
Brett Tatum 29 minutos 7 segundos
Mateo, this is gonna, I'm speaking from behalf of Harrison too. I don't know that this merging functionality is really necessary and I feel like down the road it's gonna create more kind of trouble.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
29 minutos 18 segundos29:18
Mateo Roldan Taborda 29 minutos 18 segundos
Trouble. OK, so I'll undo it.
HM
Harrison McKee
29 minutos 22 segundos29:22
Harrison McKee 29 minutos 22 segundos
I I don't know per SE.
BT
Brett Tatum
29 minutos 22 segundos29:22
Brett Tatum 29 minutos 22 segundos
Because it.
HM
Harrison McKee
29 minutos 27 segundos29:27
Harrison McKee 29 minutos 27 segundos
That it would. The only reason I say that. Oh, I don't know if I come down here. Oh no, it's gonna just bump it out.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
29 minutos 36 segundos29:36
Mateo Roldan Taborda 29 minutos 36 segundos
Hmm.
HM
Harrison McKee
29 minutos 36 segundos29:36
Harrison McKee 29 minutos 36 segundos
Duff.
Harrison McKee 29 minutos 41 segundos
Yeah, I mean, I think it's it's gonna be easy enough to copy and paste.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
29 minutos 42 segundos29:42
Mateo Roldan Taborda 29 minutos 42 segundos
Would you like? Would you like?
Mateo Roldan Taborda 29 minutos 46 segundos
OK.
HM
Harrison McKee
29 minutos 46 segundos29:46
Harrison McKee 29 minutos 46 segundos
It's gonna be easy enough to copy. I I really do like this because I would say 90% of the time this is how it's gonna work. You're gonna send four guys to the same job and they're all gonna install drywall. So like 90% of the time I would love to have this, but for the exceptions, it's gonna suck when you're trying to.
BT
Brett Tatum
29 minutos 57 segundos29:57
Brett Tatum 29 minutos 57 segundos
Yeah.
HM
Harrison McKee
30 minutos 5 segundos30:05
Harrison McKee 30 minutos 5 segundos
I would love to have this, but for the exceptions, it's gonna suck when you're trying to.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
30 minutos 9 segundos30:09
Mateo Roldan Taborda 30 minutos 9 segundos
No. Then what about the? I'll add you the option to unmarriage even with multiple, like even when you have the same job in multiple rows. That way if you have that way, if you have the exception, you can separate them from the rest of them.
HM
Harrison McKee
30 minutos 22 segundos30:22
Harrison McKee 30 minutos 22 segundos
That'd be great.
Harrison McKee 30 minutos 27 segundos
And the reason I say that to kind of shed light is a lot of these guys just need to know, show up, hang drywall, 30 sheets, start at 7:00. But Chase could be the lead on the job. And I might say, Chase, you need to come by the shop and pick up a trailer and tools and this, that and the other call.

Mateo Roldan Taborda 31 minutos 17 segundos
Sounds good. Awesome. So yeah, I'll give you that option as well. The reason I did is because if you have multiple people at the same place, it's easier just to have one schedule task and everything else on the same so everybody gets the same message instead of like copy and pasting everywhere.

Mateo Roldan Taborda 31 minutos 56 segundos
So here you'll be able to see the detail. Like as soon as you send an SMS, you'll get the like pretty much a record of all of the messages sent to everybody, and you'll have the ability, in case you need it, to reply back when the people text you back.

Mateo Roldan Taborda 32 minutos 29 segundos
View of all of the messages, the the people and reply back and I need this crew messages section to create validations in the future because my idea was for example like sending them a message like text one as soon as you reach to.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 32 minutos 48 segundos
To the place that you're supposed to be working. They send one and then you'll have some sort of validation, either an employer in employees or in jobs or in the scheduler saying this person is already on job and then text you whenever you finish your job. So some you'll have some sort of tracking like an automatic.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 33 minutos 7 segundos
Tracker for you. So that's an option we can build in the future. At the moment I think just being able to see the messages you send is enough, but if you need that in the future, this is going to be a possibility too, so you know.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 33 minutos 23 segundos
Yeah, those are all of the updates I have at the moment for schedulers. I hope we're on the right track. I hope you like everything that's built so far. I'll 100% make sure to to to continue delivering all of the changes.
