Brett Tatum 0 minutos 6 segundos
OK, So what it should be is we want to be pulling this.
Brett Tatum 0 minutos 12 segundos
Revised contract amount, grand total. So down here at the bottom, those guys will be eliminating contracts if they're overriding them or they'll zero them out. So we have a situation where we need to add, we will be adding potentially duplicate.
Brett Tatum 0 minutos 30 segundos
Like not duplicate uh multiple prime contracts. So we need to always be grabbing the grand total or the summation of all contracts. So if this isn't an endpoint.

OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 0 minutos 38 segundos
OK.

Brett Tatum
0 minutos 45 segundos0:45
Brett Tatum 0 minutos 45 segundos
In the API then we will have to do the math on adding up.
MT

Mateo Roldan Taborda
0 minutos 49 segundos0:49
Mateo Roldan Taborda 0 minutos 49 segundos
OK. I'll let you know because I think we do. I do. I do have the end points for that. It's just a matter of knowing what to like what to sum because at the very beginning the way I did it is that I took just one prime contract and I thought that that was because I honestly I did.
BT

Brett Tatum
0 minutos 50 segundos0:50
Brett Tatum 0 minutos 50 segundos
The contract.
Brett Tatum 0 minutos 53 segundos
OK.
MT

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 8 segundos1:08
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 8 segundos
I didn't know the system now that it was brought to my attention. OK, so I'll I'll either sum them or use the latest one. But now if we in this case, which is another case scenario, I'll make sure to take the the summation of.
BT

Brett Tatum
1 minuto 9 segundos1:09
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 9 segundos
Yeah.
MT

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 25 segundos1:25
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 25 segundos
Pretty much everything. Not the submission. That's a made-up work. The sum of the the.
BT

Brett Tatum
1 minuto 27 segundos1:27
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 27 segundos
Yeah, and I it.
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 29 segundos
Yeah, no, that's summation is the right word. Yeah, that's right. That's real word.
MT

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 32 segundos1:32
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 32 segundos
Oh, OK, then, yeah, I'll sum them up and pull up.
BT

Brett Tatum
1 minuto 34 segundos1:34
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 34 segundos
Um, but.
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 37 segundos
Yeah, but in I mean obviously if we can, if we can hit this end point, this grand, sorry I stopped sharing. If we can hit the grand total end point that would be better and that way every every project will be the exact same, just grabbing that that total.
MT

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 45 segundos1:45
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 45 segundos
OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 50 segundos
OK, OK, yeah, awesome. I'll make sure to integrate that to the system as well. If there are more variations that comes into the future with those, let me know. I know that with more variables into place, some of the values might or might not.

Where do I have local? All right, so it's pretty simple. I told you that I was going to be working on the mobile version and now everything's done. So pretty much all of the pages, home, well, I mean home was always all of the pages are now mobile.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 59 segundos
Friendly mobile friendly. So now you guys can use them on the go. There's only one page profit sharing that I couldn't finish because it took me too long, but I'll leave it for another session. It's nothing. It's nothing as of a priority. Everything else works perfectly.

Looks good. You'll be able to do what you're supposed to do in all of these pages as well, which is good, and it's organized as well. So that's what I wanted to do. There's just one more thing that I wasn't able to finish when it comes to mobile, and it's one of the models when you.

Brett Tatum 3 minutos 26 segundos
Awesome.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 35 segundos3:35
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 35 segundos
Like one of these, but for profit sharing that it's still on only desktop view, but it's nothing, nothing related to creating a a new profit or anything like that. It's just one of the sub ones, but I'll finish it in another occasion because it's nothing urgent or yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 54 segundos
So it's in like you won't.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 57 segundos
It won't impair the way that you're looking at data or the stakeholders or the views of the stakeholders. So it's nothing urgent, honestly.

Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 12 segundos

Awesome. I'm excited.

Brett Tatum 5 minutos 51 segundos
Uh, we're gonna call it like a labor.
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 56 segundos
Don't know if I wanna call it a labor communication system, but I think that's kind of what it is. We'll come up with a better name. Um, but I kinda gave you a brief just heads up on it that.

Brett Tatum 6 minutos 27 segundos
She based out of she's South American also. I don't think it's Colombia. I think she's maybe out of Venezuela.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 33 segundos6:33
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 33 segundos
OK.

Brett Tatum
6 minutos 34 segundos6:34

Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 37 segundos6:37
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 37 segundos
And.
BT
Brett Tatum
6 minutos 39 segundos6:39
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 39 segundos
She is kind of the the go between and she's very new. So the the vision is that Jose will be just communicating with her throughout the day, you know and it it's it's stuff like OK, hey plan on.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 52 segundos6:52
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 52 segundos
Yeah.

You know these three guys being back at their same job site tomorrow. Or hey, Manuel's going to be out for the next three days. Take him off the schedule. Or hey, we just got noticed that we need to be on this job next Tuesday. Put that on the.

7 minutos 6 segundos7:06
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 6 segundos
OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
7 minutos 13 segundos7:13
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 13 segundos
Schedule. So we're going to try to keep this as simple as we can out of the gate, but I think there's a lot of opportunity to kind of create a little more robust.
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 24 segundos
Call it first, you know, labor tracking system. The first thing we want is a way for Camilla, who's Jose's assistant Camilla, to be able to fill out a form.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 24 segundos7:24
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 24 segundos
System, of course.
BT
Brett Tatum
7 minutos 39 segundos7:39
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 39 segundos
Probably that something that looks like an Excel spreadsheet. So they already kind of have an Excel spreadsheet that they're working in. So I need to find where that is. And ultimately this leads to a conversation with like the guy who runs that business for us. His name's Harrison and then probably Jose and then maybe even Camila on a call with you and I.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 48 segundos7:48
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 48 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
7 minutos 58 segundos7:58
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 58 segundos
To be like, how do you guys use it? But effectively what we're wanting to do is she's got some sort of form that she can fill out with the four or five pieces of information that every guy needs to know for their next day.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 58 segundos7:58
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 58 segundos
OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
8 minutos 15 segundos8:15
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 15 segundos
And then she we want the ability for her to push that information out to all of those guys via text message.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 23 segundos8:23
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 23 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
8 minutos 25 segundos8:25
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 25 segundos
Um.
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 27 segundos
And at least right now, that's what we need.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 31 segundos8:31
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 31 segundos
That's the MVP.
BT
Brett Tatum
8 minutos 33 segundos8:33
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 33 segundos
Yep.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 34 segundos8:34
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 34 segundos
Sounds good. So here's what I'm going to do because I did looked into it over the weekend because that's something that really piqued my interest. So what I can do, as you said, I'm going to create a piece for a form that they can actually fill out and then.
BT
Brett Tatum
8 minutos 38 segundos8:38
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 38 segundos
Yeah.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 49 segundos8:49
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 49 segundos
Kind of like a dashboard where all of the employees can leave. And based on that I'll create something that whenever you just click it, it'll send an automatic message right away to right away to all of them. Is that simple enough for for everybody?
Brett Tatum
9 minutos 5 segundos9:05
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 5 segundos
Yep.
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 7 segundos
Yeah, I mean, that's that's.
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 10 segundos
I'm hoping it's simple.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
9 minutos 10 segundos9:10
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 10 segundos
And inside of the, yeah, and inside of the kind of like employee detail page, it's just going to be kind of like a.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 20 segundos
A way to visualize the messages that you've sent. Do you need employee information over there or not?
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 30 segundos
Or maybe not at this point.
BT
Brett Tatum
9 minutos 30 segundos9:30
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 30 segundos
Um, yes.
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 33 segundos
Yeah, so.
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 34 segundos
This is going to be the other ask as we're walking through this next build is they operate out of that system called Red Team. You know, early on I said, hey, kind of look into this. We we know they don't have an API. We've had further conversations with him. They are not going to have an API anytime soon.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
9 minutos 37 segundos9:37
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 37 segundos
Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 44 segundos
Yes.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 5 segundos
OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
10 minutos 5 segundos10:05
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 5 segundos
But can bolt run macros to pull reports out of red team and use those reports kind of like an API?
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 5 segundos10:05
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 5 segundos
OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
10 minutos 16 segundos10:16
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 16 segundos
So let me just I'm gonna share my screen. I'll just walk or I'm not sharing. I'm gonna walk through this with you.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 18 segundos10:18
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 18 segundos
Yes.
BT
Brett Tatum
10 minutos 23 segundos10:23
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 23 segundos
So red team have deconstruction.
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 34 segundos
So in this case we would.
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 38 segundos
Be wanting to pull a report.
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 42 segundos
You're the only one in here.
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 53 segundos
They, I guess, don't use. Hold on, let me see here what I'm what am I missing?
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 2 segundos
I might be in the wrong spot. Hold on a second.
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 10 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 12 segundos
So for instance, like this is the list of users.
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 18 segundos
Or guys in the system. What what I'm really getting at here is like there's a way to.
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 27 segundos
Generate that.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
11 minutos 28 segundos11:28
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
11 minutos 31 segundos11:31
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 31 segundos
And then I guess I can only print this one. I can't.
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 40 segundos
Doesn't that doesn't export to Excel, so this may not be the best place for the example.
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 52 segundos
But like in theory, OK, let's put it because one of the piece of information we're gonna want in the report is what project they're going to.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos 1 segundo12:01
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 1 segundo
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 1 segundo12:01
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 1 segundo
So I would prefer them not have to put in a like type of project into red team and type of project into their labor tracker, right? I would like them to be able to like it from a drop down or from a you know.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos 16 segundos12:16
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 16 segundos
OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 20 segundos12:20
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 20 segundos
Selection that directly pulls from red team. So in this case we do have view.
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 30 segundos
You know you can download.
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 33 segundos
An Excel copy of the project.
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 38 segundos
Overview and see this has got all their project names. I don't know how this this is filtering probably somehow, but it didn't.
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 46 segundos
Doesn't really matter. The can you run like an automated process that opens up red team, selects that report, downloads it, saves it in a certain location, then allows bolt to read that file.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 4 segundos13:04
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 4 segundos
Well, safest way to put it into words, I don't know yet, but I'll make my due diligence and investigate how to do it. I know that there is a tons of ways that we can automate jobs out there, especially lately with. I don't know if you've heard a tool called N8A.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 9 segundos13:09
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 9 segundos
Sure, that's fine.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 24 segundos13:24
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 24 segundos
Which most likely can do this kind of stuff. Let me investigate. I do have access to Red Team. I've opened it a few times. Whenever you have a chance, please give me admin rights to FD.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 29 segundos13:29
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 29 segundos
Oh.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 41 segundos13:41
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 41 segundos
That way I'll be able to investigate further and I can give you a definite answer on that. I'm not sure if this is going to be 100% doable possible if there's going to be security breaches with red team pages.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 45 segundos13:45
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 45 segundos
Yeah.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 59 segundos13:59
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 59 segundos
But I'll give it a try and I can give you a more definite answer the more we move on into the development for this new module. Does that make sense?
BT
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 10 segundos14:10
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 10 segundos
Yeah, absolutely. I think you. Yeah, the project manager has full admin rights, so if you run into any issues, let me know. But you should be good.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 19 segundos14:19
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 19 segundos
OK, I'll give it a try honestly, because it doesn't seem too complicated to do, but pretty much what it will need to do is to figure out a way to access to red team, get to the right section, pull up the right information.
BT
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 34 segundos14:34
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 34 segundos
Yep.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 36 segundos14:36
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 36 segundos
Download it and then pass it through Bolt pretty much.
BT
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 41 segundos14:41
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 41 segundos
Yeah, 'cause my my the the the bigger picture thought would be is.
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 47 segundos
There's there's probably half a dozen reports that we would want to pull out of red team on a regular basis that would create a effectively a database of information that then could.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 54 segundos14:54
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 54 segundos
Mm-hmm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 55 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
15 minutos 2 segundos15:02
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 2 segundos
Power bolt or or feed information to bolt. So like the idea would be is that like on a daily process or a multi times a day process the the macro or kind of like the bot that would be built would go into red team.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
15 minutos 5 segundos15:05
Mateo Roldan Taborda 15 minutos 5 segundos
So bold.
BT
Brett Tatum
15 minutos 18 segundos15:18
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 18 segundos
Grab all these reports, save them in a location.
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 23 segundos
And so you know you knew at 8:00 AM and at 5:00 PM all the information was gonna be updated or at 8:00 AM and noon or something like that. I don't know what the the right cadence would be. So if someone goes in and puts a new project into to red team.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
15 minutos 38 segundos15:38
Mateo Roldan Taborda 15 minutos 38 segundos
And then it automatically updates kind of like what Azure does with rocore.
BT
Brett Tatum
15 minutos 38 segundos15:38
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 38 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 40 segundos
Yes.
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 43 segundos
Yes.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
15 minutos 45 segundos15:45
Mateo Roldan Taborda 15 minutos 45 segundos
I look into it because I mean the main difference between Procore and this one is that Procore does offer an open API, right? So they make everything much more easier.
BT
Brett Tatum
15 minutos 46 segundos15:46
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 46 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 53 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 56 segundos
Yes.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
15 minutos 58 segundos15:58
Mateo Roldan Taborda 15 minutos 58 segundos
Red team, I need to look into alternatives in how to do that. So let's put the pin on that. I cannot make any promises on that yet because that will be shooting myself in the foot in terms of like what can I do on development in terms.
BT
Brett Tatum
16 minutos 12 segundos16:12
Brett Tatum 16 minutos 12 segundos
Sure.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
16 minutos 17 segundos16:17
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 17 segundos
For that, but I'll look into it is.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 21 segundos
I'll look into how feasible development on that will be on the future as well.
BT
Brett Tatum
16 minutos 25 segundos16:25
Brett Tatum 16 minutos 25 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 16 minutos 27 segundos
So I think first, first thing, let's just try to get this the the the form built and I yeah, like we don't because all of that is just gonna be additional like making it hopefully simple or simpler or more tied to red team. They'll be fine today just.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
16 minutos 28 segundos16:28
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 28 segundos

Brett Tatum 16 minutos 45 segundos
Typing in a job name. Um.
Brett Tatum 16 minutos 50 segundos
So would it be helpful to set up another meeting today with Harrison and Jose just to talk through how they use it and let them show you their reports? OK.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
16 minutos 57 segundos16:57
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 57 segundos
Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. It will be better for me to be able to like get it directly from them, how they want things, how, how they would like to see the new module for them. I'll start building and let's use the same schedule format that we've been using so far, 2 experience.
BT
Brett Tatum
17 minutos 10 segundos17:10
Brett Tatum 17 minutos 10 segundos
Perfect.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
17 minutos 16 segundos17:16
Mateo Roldan Taborda 17 minutos 16 segundos
So I can have plenty of time to develop the new module if this is going to be. I always give it two weeks, but it's probably going to be less because this is fairly simple to do. And if we finish earlier, we can again shift our focus into something else. But let's keep it that way. Two weeks usually works for.
Brett Tatum
17 minutos 34 segundos17:34
Brett Tatum 17 minutos 34 segundos
In two weeks.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
17 minutos 36 segundos17:36
Mateo Roldan Taborda 17 minutos 36 segundos
For me to be able to get you front end, back end and everything else that works.
BT
Brett Tatum
17 minutos 41 segundos17:41
Brett Tatum 17 minutos 41 segundos
Yeah, and I and I understand we're probably gonna have to pay for whatever text message system that we use, so.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
17 minutos 46 segundos17:46
Mateo Roldan Taborda 17 minutos 46 segundos
It's already it's already integrated so you are already paying for everything on the with Firebase because Firebase is all in one app like system that allows you to do pretty much everything. So all of the.
BT
Brett Tatum
17 minutos 50 segundos17:50
Brett Tatum 17 minutos 50 segundos
Oh, good.
Brett Tatum 17 minutos 56 segundos
Cool.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
18 minutos 1 segundo18:01
Mateo Roldan Taborda 18 minutos 1 segundo
Functions that run in the in the cloud. Um.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 18 minutos 5 segundos
They will start stacking up eventually, but at the moment, like the costs, the costs for operating everything that we do on bolt, it's probably like a dollar or two a month. So it's not gonna get, yeah, it's for like text messages is not gonna be much.
BT
Brett Tatum
18 minutos 14 segundos18:14
Brett Tatum 18 minutos 14 segundos
Oh, awesome.
Brett Tatum 18 minutos 21 segundos
Good.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
18 minutos 21 segundos18:21
Mateo Roldan Taborda 18 minutos 21 segundos
It's probably going to run you like a dollar or two extra a month. It's not something that we're running thousands of messages a day or thousands of users at a time. So no worries, it's not gonna, it's not gonna skyrocket anytime soon. And if there is.
BT
Brett Tatum
18 minutos 32 segundos18:32
Brett Tatum 18 minutos 32 segundos
Awesome. Awesome. So OK.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
18 minutos 36 segundos18:36
Mateo Roldan Taborda 18 minutos 36 segundos
The need for additional systems that we do need to pay for, I'll let you know, but at the moment, don't worry.
BT
Brett Tatum
18 minutos 41 segundos18:41
Brett Tatum 18 minutos 41 segundos
Cool. OK, well, I'll set up. I'm gonna call Harrison just as soon as we hang up to see what his schedule looks like today, but I'll try to get it something on schedule for this morning. So that way you've got that information to run with.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
18 minutos 43 segundos18:43
Mateo Roldan Taborda 18 minutos 43 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 18 minutos 47 segundos
No.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 18 minutos 50 segundos
Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 18 minutos 53 segundos
Yeah, absolutely. I'll start working on that right away. Just a heads up as well. You are going to be seeing the module because you have admin access right away, but nobody else. This is going to be only for admins and FD people.
BT
Brett Tatum
19 minutos 2 segundos19:02
Brett Tatum 19 minutos 2 segundos
Yeah. OK, perfect.
Brett Tatum 19 minutos 7 segundos
Awesome. Yep. Yep. For right now, it's exactly what it's gonna be. That's exactly right.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
19 minutos 9 segundos19:09
Mateo Roldan Taborda 19 minutos 9 segundos
Sounds good.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 19 minutos 11 segundos
Yeah, exactly. So you'll you'll be able to see it like on your regular view, but just rest assured nobody else is going to be able to see it unless they have admin or FD access, which at the moment it's just very few people.

Mateo Roldan Taborda 0 minutos 27 segundos
Yes. So based on that, I would actually like to have your input. How would you like things to look like? What does an MVP for you going to work or the minimum requirements you want for this new module?
Mateo Roldan Taborda 0 minutos 44 segundos
To look to feel like. So I would like to get it directly from you so I can actually do a more tailored job to something that you're going to be using on a daily basis.

Harrison McKee
1 minuto 54 segundos1:54
Harrison McKee 1 minuto 54 segundos
We'll start it off and we just fill out day of the week, date, employee or 1099's name, crew member name rather. Then it's who's who was off that week, what cost code they get.
Harrison McKee 2 minutos 10 segundos
Put to I can slow down and recap this here in a minute, but.
BT
Brett Tatum
2 minutos 13 segundos2:13
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 13 segundos
Yeah.
HM
Harrison McKee
2 minutos 15 segundos2:15
Harrison McKee 2 minutos 15 segundos
Hours worked for the W2 guys for that day.
Harrison McKee 2 minutos 20 segundos
Job location as referred to in red team.
Harrison McKee 2 minutos 25 segundos
What? What is their scheduled task for the day? What got changed once they got to site or throughout the day? Any notes in these note boxes kind of go two ways if Jamie or I have something to tell the crew.
Harrison McKee 2 minutos 42 segundos
IE Camila or Jose will put it in there and vice versa. At the end of the day, if they have something to respond with, they'll fill it out.
Harrison McKee 2 minutos 51 segundos
Task not completed or need more time. Explain the issues if we have to go back and then materials needed kind of moving forward and we've run that same column broken out day by day, just separated by a black line to go to Wednesday to go to Thursday.
Harrison McKee 3 minutos 9 segundos
So on and so forth. I mean, this is pretty basic, but it serves its purpose for right now. The biggest thing we're looking for is trying to get this in the hands of the guys actually performing the work.
Mateo Roldan Taborda

3 minutos 24 segundos3:24
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 24 segundos
So quick question over here. So you're these the only person editing this Excel sheet. How many people? Everybody like all of the employees.
HM
Harrison McKee
3 minutos 33 segundos3:33
Harrison McKee 3 minutos 33 segundos
No.
Harrison McKee 3 minutos 34 segundos
12345 We'll touch the sheet in one way, shape or form.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 42 segundos3:42
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 42 segundos
OK, sounds good. Um, and they're going to be filling usually.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 50 segundos
Walk with me again. Which are the columns that they're going to be filling like the people?
HM
Harrison McKee
3 minutos 55 segundos3:55
Harrison McKee 3 minutos 55 segundos
So like the project manager for instance, which is me and Jamie for now will come through here. This is, this is this week's jobs. So this is what's going on today. For tomorrow we will come in here and.

Mhm.
HM
Harrison McKee
4 minutos 10 segundos4:10
Harrison McKee 4 minutos 10 segundos
Put whatever task we may have, and for the sake of it, let's just say I'm going to send somebody to job number one tomorrow. If I know a specific person on the crew, I'll call it out.
BT
Brett Tatum
4 minutos 18 segundos4:18
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 18 segundos
Mhm.
HM
Harrison McKee
4 minutos 24 segundos4:24
Harrison McKee 4 minutos 24 segundos
And for right now, I'll just use Walker as an example. I'll call him out, but if I don't know, I leave it blank and let Jose assign. Jose is our crew leader. He assigns all the names.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
4 minutos 29 segundos4:29
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 29 segundos
So.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 38 segundos
Mhm.
HM
Harrison McKee
4 minutos 40 segundos4:40
Harrison McKee 4 minutos 40 segundos
To the blank slots as far as who he thinks will do best work in that case scenario. Then I get I fill out the job name, I fill out the address, I fill out what I want done out on that job tomorrow.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
4 minutos 43 segundos4:43
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 43 segundos
OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 48 segundos
Got it.

Brett Tatum
4 minutos 57 segundos4:57
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 57 segundos
OK.
HM
Harrison McKee
4 minutos 57 segundos4:57
Harrison McKee 4 minutos 57 segundos
Jose puts the names with it. Jose slash Camilla will put the names with it and the hours worked with it, and then the added tasks will come from Camilla and Jose's side. And that's more so to reflect back to us kind of if we tell them to go out there and do drywall install.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
4 minutos 58 segundos4:58
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 58 segundos
OK.
HM
Harrison McKee
5 minutos 17 segundos5:17
Harrison McKee 5 minutos 17 segundos
And they get there and all the windows on the front of the building are open and they got shifted to cover up windows instead of installing any drywall. We have a way of documenting that so we don't show up out there and the project management team thinks it should be drywalled and it's not drywalled.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
5 minutos 37 segundos5:37
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 37 segundos
OK, makes sense.
BT
Brett Tatum
5 minutos 37 segundos5:37
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 37 segundos
So, Harrison, let's break. Can we break this down into a couple of pieces? What's the information that needs to be communicated via text daily?
HM
Harrison McKee
5 minutos 46 segundos5:46
Harrison McKee 5 minutos 46 segundos
The stuff that needs to be communicated daily is it needs to get to set employees with what day, date, job name, location and scope of work they're performing.

Brett Tatum
5 minutos 58 segundos5:58
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 58 segundos
Hey Mateo, tell me if you think I'm correct on this. I think our text message systems will have limitations on number of characters. Think that's gonna be the case?
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
5 minutos 59 segundos5:59
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 59 segundos
Sounds good.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 10 segundos
Not necessarily, but OK, yeah, not necessarily is going to have a a character limit, so I wouldn't worry about that, honestly.
BT
Brett Tatum
6 minutos 12 segundos6:12
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 12 segundos
OK, good.
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 21 segundos
OK, OK, awesome. So that gives us plenty of flexibility to kind of craft how the message reads.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 27 segundos6:27
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 27 segundos
Because the MVP that I was actually thinking, we can actually include everything that we're doing like you're doing on the Excel sheet. But the most critical piece of information that we actually need to pull to bolt right away would be the messaging system. So having somewhere.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 46 segundos
Kind of like centralized where you can message everybody on the go without having to do it individually.
HM
Harrison McKee
6 minutos 51 segundos6:51
Harrison McKee 6 minutos 51 segundos
Or is it?
Harrison McKee 6 minutos 53 segundos
Are we trying to do this with in bolt?
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 54 segundos6:54
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 54 segundos
Yep.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 56 segundos
Within Vault, yes. Eventually this is going to go to Vault too. But the very first thing that we're going to be creating that I'm going to be creating for you is going to be a way to for you to select everybody who's working with you currently.
HM
Harrison McKee
6 minutos 57 segundos6:57
Harrison McKee 6 minutos 57 segundos
OK, OK.
Harrison McKee 7 minutos 1 segundo
OK.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 11 segundos7:11
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 11 segundos
Message them the job name, the address and the schedule tasks. Am I right? Those are the three critical information you guys need to to to deliver to everybody, right?
HM
Harrison McKee
7 minutos 24 segundos7:24
Harrison McKee 7 minutos 24 segundos
So is there a way to make like individual groups within that I consider sending one last text? Is it?
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 31 segundos7:31
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 31 segundos
Sorry, I couldn't hear you well.
HM
Harrison McKee
7 minutos 32 segundos7:32
Harrison McKee 7 minutos 32 segundos
I think she said. Is there a way to make groups? But I don't think it's going to be so much off of groups. I think like it the system will be smart enough to pull whatever job name is assigned where everybody's getting their individual texts. Thank you.
BT
Brett Tatum
7 minutos 46 segundos7:46
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 46 segundos
Exactly, exactly.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda

Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 46 segundos
Yes, mm-hmm, yes.
HM
Harrison McKee
7 minutos 48 segundos7:48
Harrison McKee 7 minutos 48 segundos
Like you're not gonna have to create a group text that sends the nine guys or whatever if she's gonna send.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 50 segundos7:50
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 50 segundos
Oh.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 52 segundos
No, no, no. This is not going to be WhatsApp where you're going to have a this is not going to be a a messaging app where you go back and forward with everybody. It's just a way for you to send critical information about the job site to your employees.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 8 segundos
Pretty much kind of like how to do everything quickly for for everybody. Does that make sense?
HM
Harrison McKee
8 minutos 9 segundos8:09
Harrison McKee 8 minutos 9 segundos
Yeah.
Harrison McKee 8 minutos 16 segundos
Correct. Yeah. I mean, the stuff that I think that's important is those first five that I talked about. I do think there would be a need to have.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 16 segundos8:16
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 16 segundos
Yeah, OK. Uh.
HM
Harrison McKee
8 minutos 25 segundos8:25
Harrison McKee 8 minutos 25 segundos
Just to kind of catch all bucket where you can put in if there's lock box codes, if there's special tools that need to get picked up at the shop.
Harrison McKee 8 minutos 35 segundos
Those kind of like fluid information that's not just name, address, time, you know what I mean? Like there needs to be a little bit of a flexible bucket that might have to get filled out for each individual job as needed, but it would be more of a one off. Hey, you've got to come by because there's two pallets of tile.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 50 segundos8:50
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 50 segundos
Mhm.

Harrison McKee 8 minutos 55 segundos
All that need to go with you to that job.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 58 segundos8:58
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 58 segundos
Got it. Yeah, definitely. I'll I'll include somewhat some flexibility for you to customize the message if you need to as well for individuals. So yeah, no worries. The way this is going to work from my end and the way I'm going to be communicating updates to you, I'm going to focus on delivering to you an MVP.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 18 segundos
Based on that, we're going to shift our focus on delivering more in-depth updates for your team specifically. So think about these. You're going to be working for me for several weeks while I'll give you regular updates on the job done.
HM
Harrison McKee

Harrison McKee 10 minutos 2 segundos
Go ahead.
Harrison McKee 10 minutos 3 segundos
On the text message, is there a way to have the address like hyperlink to take them to like Google Maps or like the, you know, Apple Maps or something like that so that they can like they don't have to like type in the address and somehow it get, you know, messed up?
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 16 segundos10:16
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 16 segundos
Yeah, of course.
HM
Harrison McKee
10 minutos 22 segundos10:22
Harrison McKee 10 minutos 22 segundos
From them trying to translate it to their mapping software.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 27 segundos10:27
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 27 segundos
I believe so. So yeah, I can look into it to add the the hyperlink included as soon as you send it. So it's easier for them and for you as well without having to well, pretty much everybody having to type the address manually again in somewhere.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 43 segundos
In a different app, but yeah, I'll try to include that as well in the MVP for you.
HM
Harrison McKee
10 minutos 47 segundos10:47
Harrison McKee 10 minutos 47 segundos
And.
Harrison McKee 10 minutos 49 segundos
One other question I had to add is like whenever we create more or less all what 30 of these guys are gonna have a different.
Harrison McKee 10 minutos 58 segundos
Rolodex or contact card built into the system. Is there a way to select which language they receive their texts in?
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
11 minutos 3 segundos11:03
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 3 segundos
Yep.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 9 segundos
I'm guessing you have guys who speak multiple languages.
HM
Harrison McKee
11 minutos 12 segundos11:12
Harrison McKee 11 minutos 12 segundos
Yeah, we have.
BT
Brett Tatum
11 minutos 13 segundos11:13
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 13 segundos
No, we have guys who speak one language. It's just not all the same language.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
11 minutos 17 segundos11:17
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 17 segundos
Yeah, I gotcha. No. Yeah, definitely. One thing that I'm going to be working on is we're going to be adding all of your employees to Bolt. I'm guessing like for these to be able to work, some of the people will need somewhat access to Bolt. The people who are going to be getting the messages, no need, but I'm going to be creating something.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 37 segundos
Inside of this component called a detail page, which is basically going to be able to save preferences, names, emails, phone numbers, things that we're going to use to communicate with people automatically, right? So in that I can actually include the preferred language, either be I'm guessing Spanish for some of these guys.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 57 segundos
Or whatever other language they they speak so that the system knows in what language to send the message.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 6 segundos
Make sense?
HM
Harrison McKee
12 minutos 6 segundos12:06
Harrison McKee 12 minutos 6 segundos
OK, yeah, makes sense.
BT
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 8 segundos12:08
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 8 segundos
Now, Mateo, just thinking about the actual development of this, like the way that they're currently capturing the information, obviously what we're is what we're trying to recreate, but effectively what is gonna have to be created is.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos 8 segundos12:08
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 8 segundos
OK, awesome. Yep.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 19 segundos
Yeah.
BT
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 24 segundos12:24
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 24 segundos
A date like I'm I'm saying a database, but it's a spread, you know, whatever we we gotta create a database of.
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 32 segundos
Projects like a, you know, like there has to be a way to add a new project. You put the address in there, you're gonna put the scheduled tasks in there. Like we won't be able to have it in a spreadsheet that just goes horizontally like this, basically.
Harrison McKee
12 minutos 49 segundos12:49
Harrison McKee 12 minutos 49 segundos
Brilliant.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos 50 segundos12:50
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 50 segundos
Yeah, it's going to be different.
BT
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 51 segundos12:51
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 51 segundos
Yeah. So we'll, I think once you kind of get just the first pass, Mateo, we probably need to make sure like just before you tie in any of the back end, just from a user interface, you know, make sure we're having a quick follow up call to.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos13:00
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 7 segundos
No, absolutely.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 7 segundos13:07
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 7 segundos
To make sure it's usable for those guys.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 10 segundos13:10
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 10 segundos
Absolutely. That's going to come kind of like in a second phase of development. Again, as I said before, what I want to get for you, the MVP, I want to get a way for you to communicate with the crew as easy as possible without as few clicks as possible for you guys, right?
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 28 segundos
Then after that's done, we can discuss how to create, how to try to recreate all of these in a more intuitive way for the whole team so that you don't have to rely on an Excel sheet, but in a more advanced or more.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 44 segundos
Tailor system for all of.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 48 segundos
That works.
HM
Harrison McKee
13 minutos 50 segundos13:50
Harrison McKee 13 minutos 50 segundos
Yeah, I was wondering if we could basically put the Excel sheet itself into Bolt more or less, if that makes sense or something similar. And Brett, I know we talked about it, but like to where it's even if it's just the job name itself and the job address box.
Harrison McKee 14 minutos 7 segundos
Breeze or pulls like from honest like a drop down or a search that ties back to red team in some way, shape or form.
BT
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 14 segundos14:14
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 14 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 18 segundos
So that piece is gonna be Mateo and I've already talked about that, and it's certainly part of the development for this, but kind of like a phase two or a phase three because there's a bigger component there. Like can we actually run background tasks to pull reports out of red team, save them somewhere so that data can be accessed?
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 37 segundos
Out of the gate, I think it makes more sense to just get a usable product where you either type in a job or we create a little just job Rolodex within bolt.
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 50 segundos
Um, and then work our way towards that like integration piece.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 54 segundos14:54
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 54 segundos
Yes, because at at the moment, Harrison, there's a thing that happens with like a third party apps. Not everybody wants to share the access of their apps with everyone else. And at the moment that red team develop their their own tool, they don't share.
HM
Harrison McKee
14 minutos 55 segundos14:55
Harrison McKee 14 minutos 55 segundos
OK.

Mateo Roldan Taborda

Those kind of things on how to connect to their app publicly, right? So we need to look for ways on how we can actually get around that, which isn't as easy as it sounds. It's a bit more difficult to do it. For example, there are other tools that the company currently uses, such as Procore.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 15 minutos 32 segundos
That allows us to connect directly with them, but with Red Tim, it's a little bit more difficult to do so. So that's something definitely we are looking into, but.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 15 minutos 45 segundos
It's we still need to know the full scope on how things are going to be developed on our end.

Harrison McKee 15 minutos 47 segundos
Or.
Harrison McKee 15 minutos 50 segundos
I mean for right now, yes, I'm I'm guessing it's as easy as whenever we have the job created and dropped into red team, we just add that to the To Do List, create the job in red team, create the folder, create the job in bolt.

Yeah, and don't worry, I'm just going to try to make everything as simple as possible so you don't have, so you guys don't have to juggle through 1000 things. So yeah, Brett already has the experience of working with me for a few months. So trust me, I'm going to make sure to take care to take care of you guys as much as possible.

Brett Tatum 16 minutos 22 segundos
You're you're, yeah, we're in good hands on getting this, this build.
Brett Tatum 16 minutos 30 segundos
Just as we're thinking about how this could work in the future, Harrison, is there any need or want for the ability to respond back to text messages that then potentially could infill information?
HM
Harrison McKee
16 minutos 42 segundos16:42
Harrison McKee 16 minutos 42 segundos
I think that would be like I could see.
Harrison McKee 16 minutos 47 segundos
Depending on how complex or how easy it is to use, I could see where it would be beneficial to get something back like arrived at site message. So like you've got a automated way of basically tracking when the guy showed up.
Harrison McKee 17 minutos 5 segundos
Or at least verifying that they did show up that day, even if it wasn't first thing, you just have kind of have a verification that they made it to site. And then I think at the end of the day it'd be nice to have like a prompt to get pictures or something back.

Harrison McKee 17 minutos 21 segundos
Show me what you did today. Yeah, it might be I hung drywall and they just take a picture of drywall hanging on studs, but at least you have some sort of documentation proof, something to show for what they did.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
17 minutos 36 segundos17:36
Mateo Roldan Taborda 17 minutos 36 segundos
Yeah, definitely. I'll I'll look into it with while I develop.
HM
Harrison McKee
17 minutos 39 segundos17:39
Harrison McKee 17 minutos 39 segundos
The the biggest thing I think of, I'm sorry, I said the biggest thing I think of is the guys in the field are very like everything's text message. They don't go into the app every time we've tried to have like log your time with an app or respond back with emails.
Harrison McKee 17 minutos 55 segundos
I guess too cumbersome. The easiest thing to do is keep it as simple as possible. We've had good luck with asking them like, hey, I'll call them and shoot me some text pictures and I'll get pictures in a few minutes. So like, I know that they'll do that if it's something as easy as just texting.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
17 minutos 59 segundos17:59
Mateo Roldan Taborda 17 minutos 59 segundos
Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 18 minutos 14 segundos
Yeah, definitely. I'll I'll I'll help you out guys with something like that. The easiest way that I can actually think to accomplish that is that as soon as we send them the message, we send something like type one. If you arrive to to, I don't know how you call that in English to to the site, to the job site and if they type.
Brett Tatum
18 minutos 20 segundos18:20
Brett Tatum 18 minutos 20 segundos
Yeah.
HM
Harrison McKee
18 minutos 33 segundos18:33
Harrison McKee 18 minutos 33 segundos
Yeah.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
18 minutos 33 segundos18:33
Mateo Roldan Taborda 18 minutos 33 segundos
One, the system recognizes that and logs them into an update saying these are all of the people who have replied who haven't replied, so you have somewhat more control to everybody.
HM
Harrison McKee
18 minutos 45 segundos18:45
Harrison McKee 18 minutos 45 segundos
Yep. Thank you.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
18 minutos 46 segundos18:46
Mateo Roldan Taborda 18 minutos 46 segundos
Like you'll be able to visualize what I mean better, like down the road, but it's something that might be worth like to keep it simple, you know?
HM
Harrison McKee
18 minutos 56 segundos18:56
Harrison McKee 18 minutos 56 segundos
So if they have like a start time, so like if the text message sends them like a start time of like 7:00 AM or 8:00 AM, is there a way to send that text one or something like maybe 30 minutes or an hour before they're supposed to arrive? That way they know to text cause like if you send it.
Harrison McKee 19 minutos 16 segundos
If we send out the text the night before and then they get that text message right away, they're not going to remember to respond.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
19 minutos 22 segundos19:22
Mateo Roldan Taborda 19 minutos 22 segundos
Yeah, absolutely. We can schedule reminders as you guys please. So that's not gonna be an issue whatsoever. It's just a matter of discussing down that later down the road. So we know what kind of schedule reminders we want to send out to the team.
HM
Harrison McKee
19 minutos 30 segundos19:30
Harrison McKee 19 minutos 30 segundos
OK.
Harrison McKee 19 minutos 38 segundos

Mateo Roldan Taborda
19 minutos 39 segundos19:39
Mateo Roldan Taborda 19 minutos 39 segundos
Mm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 19 minutos 41 segundos
So the way this is going to work, just so you guys know, I require a two week screen where I'm going to be focusing the first week of that on the front end, then the second. Once you're happy with the front end, I'm going to be circling back to the back end, which is basically giving out the actual functionality to to to the app with.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 20 minutos 1 segundo
Them bolt. So you kind of like guys know that everything's going to be working together. Within those two weeks, I'm going to be giving you regular updates where like all of the work is done and if you find something that you don't like or you want to change, just let me know.

I don't know something weird happened over there. All right, so you you will still see this. This is not how the going to look like the final product. This is the minimum viable tool that I need to continue developing the the sending messages.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 0 minutos 39 segundos
But what I'm currently doing, let me show you over here through Twilo, is the A2P campaigns registration. What this actually means is that kind of like imagine that when you're going to a cell phone.

Mateo Roldan Taborda 0 minutos 55 segundos
Company whenever they're activating your phone number. This is pretty much the process that I have to do to do it remotely. Through Twilo I had to do to a few things, the A2P100 DLC, whatever registration which basically.
BT

Brett Tatum
0 minutos 58 segundos0:58
Brett Tatum 0 minutos 58 segundos
Yep.
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 3 segundos
Yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 13 segundos1:13
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 13 segundos
Means that we are not going to be sending spam to users through our app. Then as soon as you do that, we have to register pretty much a type Co FD company with Twilo as well, which I already did.
BT

Brett Tatum
1 minuto 18 segundos1:18
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 18 segundos
OK.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 30 segundos1:30
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 30 segundos
And now the very last step on doing that is creating a campaign which will allow us to pretty much message everyone who's employed by by by FD companies, peer companies, pretty much the the peer companies umbrella, right?
BT

Brett Tatum
1 minuto 44 segundos1:44
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 44 segundos
OK, great.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 47 segundos1:47
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 47 segundos
I actually did that last night because I spent the last Friday trying to kind of like figuring out where the messages were going, so I've sent multiple of them.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 3 segundos
Most of these are actually being sent to to chase, just kind of like to to test and he's not getting them right. So after investigation, yeah, after some investigation on what's going on, it's I got to.
BT

Brett Tatum
2 minutos 9 segundos2:09
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 9 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 14 segundos
OK.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
2 minutos 22 segundos2:22
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 22 segundos
The errors, which you'll be able to see over here in a second verify.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 32 segundos
Messenger.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 34 segundos
Which everything's like all of the messages I've sent through the app are undelivered, undelivered, undelivered. They're not sending right? So after inspecting what I get is this error. There means that we're currently not registered with Twillo, which is currently what I'm doing.
BT
Brett Tatum
2 minutos 44 segundos2:44
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 44 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 53 segundos
Um.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
2 minutos 54 segundos2:54
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 54 segundos
It usually takes somewhere around a few hours to up to 48 hours. So I already did the process, everything submitted through here, so I'm just waiting for to get the number kind of like good to go.
BT
Brett Tatum
2 minutos 54 segundos2:54
Brett Tatum 2 minutos 54 segundos
OK.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 10 segundos3:10
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 10 segundos
Per messages, the usual cost is going to be about 3 cents, no 0.3 cents, which is good. It's fairly cheap to send messages. So because I'm still waiting on the approval by Twilo, what I'm going to be doing today.
BT
Brett Tatum
3 minutos 17 segundos3:17
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 17 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 3 minutos 18 segundos
Yeah, yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 28 segundos3:28
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 28 segundos
Oh, this is something I need to show you also. What I'm going to be doing today is just focusing on the front end. I'm going to you can. I'm still going to ignore the jobs after I finish playing around with messages. What I'm going to do is create the whole chat box and a modal for people to for.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 47 segundos
Everybody at FD to be able to select what job they're going to be sending, the crew members, uh, the date, the language, either Spanish or English. I don't know if there's any other language that we need, but will be included here too as well on some notes pretty much.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 2 segundos
But in a more intuitive way.
Brett Tatum
4 minutos 3 segundos4:03
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 3 segundos
So now it it is this just like a little sidebar 'cause this this isn't really what they want. They don't really want, OK?

Mateo Roldan Taborda
4 minutos 9 segundos4:09
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 9 segundos
No, no, no.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 11 segundos
No, this is.

Brett Tatum 4 minutos 13 segundos
OK.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
4 minutos 14 segundos4:14
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 14 segundos
This is not this is going to be kind of like a a button pretty much. Yeah, I placed it like this because I just need to be able to send the message and this actually gives me a lot of details about it, right? But I'm I'm literally going to be building kind of like a WhatsApp box pretty much so that they can tag.
BT
Brett Tatum
4 minutos 17 segundos4:17
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 17 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 26 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 4 minutos 33 segundos
OK.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
4 minutos 33 segundos4:33
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 33 segundos
They can go back and forward, but automate it, right? So for example, it's going to be a button over here, send job details. They're gonna be able to select these and then they'll click send and.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 49 segundos
Like they'll get the fully customized message on somebody's.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 55 segundos
Cell phone, right? And they they're going to be able to reply, then text back in case they actually need anything. Yeah, that's what I'm going to be building. Kind of like a WhatsApp, but automated.
BT
Brett Tatum
5 minutos 7 segundos5:07
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 7 segundos
Yeah. OK. Now let me stop you, 'cause we really don't want that. So I don't want you spending time doing that unless it's just a necessary step because this phase two, phase three of this, if we get there, version two, version three may involve some back and forth.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
5 minutos 10 segundos5:10
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 10 segundos
Yeah, OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 12 segundos
OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 14 segundos
OK.

Brett Tatum
5 minutos 22 segundos5:22
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 22 segundos
Minimum viable product is we have the ability to send out an audience message to a mass group at one time. The back and forth really isn't important to us right now and the the being able to send it from like a mass.

Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 43 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 5 minutos 46 segundos
No, yeah, of course. It's like what you see over here. You have the capability to. I currently only have Chase and me, but for example you can select both of them and then just give them the details and he'll send the messages to everybody at the same time.

OK.
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 54 segundos
Sure.
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 58 segundos
Yeah, this is.
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 1 segundo
OK, I I need this to to Mateo to know that we're going in the right direction. I need to see more of like the front end of what you think we need to be able to send out like more of a table that looks like what Harrison showed us in that.

Mateo Roldan Taborda

It.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 6 segundos

Brett Tatum
6 minutos 18 segundos6:18
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 18 segundos
Initial call, because what I'm worried about is that you're building stuff that right now doesn't, doesn't really meet the minimum viable product. And again, I don't know the steps, but it would be more beneficial for me to see.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 20 segundos6:20

OK, sounds good. Um.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 43 segundos
Let me think one second. Um.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 49 segundos
Then in that case, I believe that it will be more beneficial for us to kind of like get the job part done first, because that way we're going to be able to select.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 3 segundos
Multiple jobs. Um.

They need to have completed or the tests are going to be completing. Address would be nice. They don't have that added in there. Any notes?
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 47 segundos
So this like they want to be filling out something that looks visually similar to this and once they get it completed they want to be able to hit a button that says basically send and everyone who's on the list for the day receives a text that says hey on Monday 29.

Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 15 segundos
Got it.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 20 segundos
Got it. Yeah. Then instead of the path that I was going to be taking, yeah, let me focus on these three to actually get this on something that they can just fill out on the go without the need to click on a button to add all of the details. Pretty much kind of like an Excel.

Brett Tatum 10 minutos 38 segundos
But now a couple, a couple things they will need. I mean, I think they'll need a form to be adding all their employees. So they'll have to, you know, just like you have in your what's already built in bolt currently like, yeah, so like they have employees, so they need a place they can add all their employees because they got to put all the information in. So that makes.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 40 segundos10:40
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 40 segundos
With.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 50 segundos
Yeah, the employee's already over there.
BT
Brett Tatum
10 minutos 58 segundos10:58
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 58 segundos
Makes sense. They need a place they can add jobs.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
11 minutos 3 segundos11:03
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 3 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
11 minutos 3 segundos11:03
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 3 segundos
And so that job name then has an address with it. Scheduled task needs to be free form because they need to be able to type in whatever they want them doing for the next day. Notes needs to be free form.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
11 minutos 13 segundos11:13
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 13 segundos
It.
BT
Brett Tatum
11 minutos 22 segundos11:22
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 22 segundos
Materials needed needs to be free form. At that point I think we have minimum viable product, so like column L.
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 32 segundos
We can work on because they're that's gonna be that's gonna have like a two way component to it and I don't want to get into the two way messaging yet. Added tasks. We can leave that off for now and we can leave off those 3 for right now.
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 48 segundos
Well, I guess we can include it, just don't make them like kind of mandatory, just make them optional fields. But I think this is the direction we need to head on the front end.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
11 minutos 52 segundos11:52
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 52 segundos
OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 11 minutos 57 segundos
OK, sounds good. Then can you go back to Bolt one second?
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 3 segundos
Then I guess employee tab is already done, which is good. I'm going to leave it as it is. Jobs tab. I mean, I'll leave it as it is as well because right now we add the details of.
BT
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 7 segundos12:07
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 7 segundos
Yep, Yep.
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 16 segundos
Yeah, but you wanna eliminate tasks because tasks needs to be unique to each daily request, not unique to the job.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos 18 segundos12:18
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 18 segundos
Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 22 segundos
Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 24 segundos
Yeah, so it's kind of like it's going to be like employees, job name, address.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 30 segundos
That's it.
BT
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 31 segundos12:31
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 31 segundos
Yeah, that's really it. I'm trying to think what else.
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 36 segundos
Yeah.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos 38 segundos12:38
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 38 segundos
Yeah, there's not even need a need for a job detail page either, because we only need the job name and the address for job.
BT
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 39 segundos12:39
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 39 segundos
Yeah, I think that's it.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos 47 segundos12:47
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 47 segundos
Maybe exected comletition?
BT
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 49 segundos12:49
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 49 segundos
No, I mean, hey, it's not a bad field to have, but at the same time it's not gonna serve them in this capacity. I I did have a thought that.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos 57 segundos12:57
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 57 segundos
Yeah, true.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 5 segundos13:05
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 5 segundos
Cost code. So in in the world of commercial construction, every activity that's completed has a six digit numerical cost code associated with it.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 15 segundos13:15
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 15 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 18 segundos13:18
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 18 segundos
Um.
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 20 segundos
These cost codes are known at the beginning of a job, so I do think that maybe over here in our jobs field we should have like when you're adding a job, you should have an option to put in the cost codes.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 31 segundos13:31
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 31 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 32 segundos13:32
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 32 segundos
So that way when, when or if they want to use them on this sheet, it's more of a drop down. So once you've selected Burger King, you can select a cost code, but it's only one of the cost codes that's already been established for Burger King.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 42 segundos13:42
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 42 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 47 segundos
Oh, OK, sounds good.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 48 segundos13:48
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 48 segundos
So really what all you would do is give.
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 52 segundos
You know, well, not, yeah, it.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 53 segundos13:53
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 53 segundos
Six different options for the Costco.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 58 segundos13:58
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 58 segundos
It'd be add and then probably what we would need to do or work with Harrison's at this point. Give me a drop down here, give me a a a free text field for cost code, but we'll probably change that. I'll be able to get you a fully comprehensive list of cost codes and descriptions.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 10 segundos14:10
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 10 segundos
Mhm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 15 segundos
OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 17 segundos14:17
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 17 segundos
That we can use as a dropdown selection.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 19 segundos14:19
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 19 segundos
Yeah, I'll leave it as a free form for the time being, and then as soon as you get it to me, I'll include it over there. Good. Sounds good. I can definitely get that to you done. Yeah, let me take that change of route.
BT
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 22 segundos14:22
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 22 segundos
Yeah, just just, yeah. OK, perfect.
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 32 segundos
OK.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 37 segundos14:37
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 37 segundos
It's good that we had this call because it had something else in mind. Um.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 44 segundos
And then, Oh yeah, I do have a homework. I do. I need to give you some homework over there. Go back to to Bolt.
BT
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 50 segundos14:50
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 50 segundos
OK, sure.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 53 segundos14:53
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 53 segundos
And do you see at the very bottom right corner terms and conditions and private policy? I had to create those two pages, open them in a different tab, both of them.
BT
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 59 segundos14:59
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 59 segundos
Yep.
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 1 segundo
OK.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
15 minutos 9 segundos15:09
Mateo Roldan Taborda 15 minutos 9 segundos
So I had to create terms and conditions and also the other one because Trilo was actually asking for the URL for those in order for us to be able to set up messaging campaigns so that in case anybody actually wants to see them, they they have the actual right.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 15 minutos 29 segundos
To to see what are the terms and condition. I created everything over here with AI, so I have no idea if this is right or wrong. So could you please give it a read? Make some changes in case I actually place over there something that has absolutely no place in bolt. Please let me know and I'll completely remove it or.
BT
Brett Tatum
15 minutos 29 segundos15:29
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 29 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 32 segundos
Correct.
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 37 segundos
That's fine. I'll review it. Yep.
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 48 segundos
Yep.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
15 minutos 49 segundos15:49
Mateo Roldan Taborda 15 minutos 49 segundos
Change it to anything you need and want, but we like to comply with their terms and conditions. I had to create both those two pages, but again because I have actually have no idea on legal terms over here when it comes to these, I just use that.
BT
Brett Tatum
15 minutos 57 segundos15:57
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 57 segundos
Yep.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
16 minutos 9 segundos16:09

BT
Brett Tatum
16 minutos 10 segundos16:10
Brett Tatum 16 minutos 10 segundos
So.
Brett Tatum 16 minutos 11 segundos
I'm sure you're really, really close though using AI, so uh, I'm good with it. OK, I have a note here to to review it.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
16 minutos 17 segundos16:17
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 17 segundos
OK, sounds good. But yeah, give it a give it a a read, make changes. If you need to let me know and then I'll include all of those changes in those two pages. You'll see it like that on when you're logged.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 33 segundos
In but when people are locked out and don't have access, they also have access to privacy policy and terms and conditions, but they won't be able to access anywhere else in into bolt.
Brett Tatum
16 minutos 46 segundos16:46
Brett Tatum 16 minutos 46 segundos
Cool. Okay, I like it. I'll take a look at it. Helpful.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
16 minutos 48 segundos16:48
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 48 segundos
Awesome.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 51 segundos
Yeah, that's all of the updates I have at the moment. I'm waiting for the very first moment until Twilo gives me the green, the green light to be able to fully set up, and then I'll do further testing on the messaging system.
