Brett Tatum 0 minutos 6 segundos
OK, So what it should be is we want to be pulling this.
Brett Tatum 0 minutos 12 segundos
Revised contract amount, grand total. So down here at the bottom, those guys will be eliminating contracts if they're overriding them or they'll zero them out. So we have a situation where we need to add, we will be adding potentially duplicate.
Brett Tatum 0 minutos 30 segundos
Like not duplicate uh multiple prime contracts. So we need to always be grabbing the grand total or the summation of all contracts. So if this isn't an endpoint.

OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 0 minutos 38 segundos
OK.

Brett Tatum
0 minutos 45 segundos0:45
Brett Tatum 0 minutos 45 segundos
In the API then we will have to do the math on adding up.
MT

Mateo Roldan Taborda
0 minutos 49 segundos0:49
Mateo Roldan Taborda 0 minutos 49 segundos
OK. I'll let you know because I think we do. I do. I do have the end points for that. It's just a matter of knowing what to like what to sum because at the very beginning the way I did it is that I took just one prime contract and I thought that that was because I honestly I did.
BT

Brett Tatum
0 minutos 50 segundos0:50
Brett Tatum 0 minutos 50 segundos
The contract.
Brett Tatum 0 minutos 53 segundos
OK.
MT

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 8 segundos1:08
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 8 segundos
I didn't know the system now that it was brought to my attention. OK, so I'll I'll either sum them or use the latest one. But now if we in this case, which is another case scenario, I'll make sure to take the the summation of.
BT

Brett Tatum
1 minuto 9 segundos1:09
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 9 segundos
Yeah.
MT

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 25 segundos1:25
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 25 segundos
Pretty much everything. Not the submission. That's a made-up work. The sum of the the.
BT

Brett Tatum
1 minuto 27 segundos1:27
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 27 segundos
Yeah, and I it.
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 29 segundos
Yeah, no, that's summation is the right word. Yeah, that's right. That's real word.
MT

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 32 segundos1:32
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 32 segundos
Oh, OK, then, yeah, I'll sum them up and pull up.
BT

Brett Tatum
1 minuto 34 segundos1:34
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 34 segundos
Um, but.
Brett Tatum 1 minuto 37 segundos
Yeah, but in I mean obviously if we can, if we can hit this end point, this grand, sorry I stopped sharing. If we can hit the grand total end point that would be better and that way every every project will be the exact same, just grabbing that that total.
MT

Mateo Roldan Taborda
1 minuto 45 segundos1:45
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 45 segundos
OK.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 1 minuto 50 segundos
OK, OK, yeah, awesome. I'll make sure to integrate that to the system as well. If there are more variations that comes into the future with those, let me know. I know that with more variables into place, some of the values might or might not.

Where do I have local? All right, so it's pretty simple. I told you that I was going to be working on the mobile version and now everything's done. So pretty much all of the pages, home, well, I mean home was always all of the pages are now mobile.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 2 minutos 59 segundos
Friendly mobile friendly. So now you guys can use them on the go. There's only one page profit sharing that I couldn't finish because it took me too long, but I'll leave it for another session. It's nothing. It's nothing as of a priority. Everything else works perfectly.

Looks good. You'll be able to do what you're supposed to do in all of these pages as well, which is good, and it's organized as well. So that's what I wanted to do. There's just one more thing that I wasn't able to finish when it comes to mobile, and it's one of the models when you.

Brett Tatum 3 minutos 26 segundos
Awesome.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
3 minutos 35 segundos3:35
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 35 segundos
Like one of these, but for profit sharing that it's still on only desktop view, but it's nothing, nothing related to creating a a new profit or anything like that. It's just one of the sub ones, but I'll finish it in another occasion because it's nothing urgent or yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 54 segundos
So it's in like you won't.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 3 minutos 57 segundos
It won't impair the way that you're looking at data or the stakeholders or the views of the stakeholders. So it's nothing urgent, honestly.

Mateo Roldan Taborda 4 minutos 12 segundos

Awesome. I'm excited.

Brett Tatum 5 minutos 51 segundos
Uh, we're gonna call it like a labor.
Brett Tatum 5 minutos 56 segundos
Don't know if I wanna call it a labor communication system, but I think that's kind of what it is. We'll come up with a better name. Um, but I kinda gave you a brief just heads up on it that.

Brett Tatum 6 minutos 27 segundos
She based out of she's South American also. I don't think it's Colombia. I think she's maybe out of Venezuela.

Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 33 segundos6:33
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 33 segundos
OK.

Brett Tatum
6 minutos 34 segundos6:34

Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 37 segundos6:37
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 37 segundos
And.
BT
Brett Tatum
6 minutos 39 segundos6:39
Brett Tatum 6 minutos 39 segundos
She is kind of the the go between and she's very new. So the the vision is that Jose will be just communicating with her throughout the day, you know and it it's it's stuff like OK, hey plan on.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
6 minutos 52 segundos6:52
Mateo Roldan Taborda 6 minutos 52 segundos
Yeah.

You know these three guys being back at their same job site tomorrow. Or hey, Manuel's going to be out for the next three days. Take him off the schedule. Or hey, we just got noticed that we need to be on this job next Tuesday. Put that on the.

7 minutos 6 segundos7:06
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 6 segundos
OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
7 minutos 13 segundos7:13
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 13 segundos
Schedule. So we're going to try to keep this as simple as we can out of the gate, but I think there's a lot of opportunity to kind of create a little more robust.
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 24 segundos
Call it first, you know, labor tracking system. The first thing we want is a way for Camilla, who's Jose's assistant Camilla, to be able to fill out a form.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 24 segundos7:24
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 24 segundos
System, of course.
BT
Brett Tatum
7 minutos 39 segundos7:39
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 39 segundos
Probably that something that looks like an Excel spreadsheet. So they already kind of have an Excel spreadsheet that they're working in. So I need to find where that is. And ultimately this leads to a conversation with like the guy who runs that business for us. His name's Harrison and then probably Jose and then maybe even Camila on a call with you and I.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 48 segundos7:48
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 48 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
7 minutos 58 segundos7:58
Brett Tatum 7 minutos 58 segundos
To be like, how do you guys use it? But effectively what we're wanting to do is she's got some sort of form that she can fill out with the four or five pieces of information that every guy needs to know for their next day.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
7 minutos 58 segundos7:58
Mateo Roldan Taborda 7 minutos 58 segundos
OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
8 minutos 15 segundos8:15
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 15 segundos
And then she we want the ability for her to push that information out to all of those guys via text message.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 23 segundos8:23
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 23 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
8 minutos 25 segundos8:25
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 25 segundos
Um.
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 27 segundos
And at least right now, that's what we need.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 31 segundos8:31
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 31 segundos
That's the MVP.
BT
Brett Tatum
8 minutos 33 segundos8:33
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 33 segundos
Yep.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 34 segundos8:34
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 34 segundos
Sounds good. So here's what I'm going to do because I did looked into it over the weekend because that's something that really piqued my interest. So what I can do, as you said, I'm going to create a piece for a form that they can actually fill out and then.
BT
Brett Tatum
8 minutos 38 segundos8:38
Brett Tatum 8 minutos 38 segundos
Yeah.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
8 minutos 49 segundos8:49
Mateo Roldan Taborda 8 minutos 49 segundos
Kind of like a dashboard where all of the employees can leave. And based on that I'll create something that whenever you just click it, it'll send an automatic message right away to right away to all of them. Is that simple enough for for everybody?
Brett Tatum
9 minutos 5 segundos9:05
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 5 segundos
Yep.
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 7 segundos
Yeah, I mean, that's that's.
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 10 segundos
I'm hoping it's simple.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
9 minutos 10 segundos9:10
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 10 segundos
And inside of the, yeah, and inside of the kind of like employee detail page, it's just going to be kind of like a.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 20 segundos
A way to visualize the messages that you've sent. Do you need employee information over there or not?
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 30 segundos
Or maybe not at this point.
BT
Brett Tatum
9 minutos 30 segundos9:30
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 30 segundos
Um, yes.
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 33 segundos
Yeah, so.
Brett Tatum 9 minutos 34 segundos
This is going to be the other ask as we're walking through this next build is they operate out of that system called Red Team. You know, early on I said, hey, kind of look into this. We we know they don't have an API. We've had further conversations with him. They are not going to have an API anytime soon.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
9 minutos 37 segundos9:37
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 37 segundos
Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 9 minutos 44 segundos
Yes.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 5 segundos
OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
10 minutos 5 segundos10:05
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 5 segundos
But can bolt run macros to pull reports out of red team and use those reports kind of like an API?
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 5 segundos10:05
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 5 segundos
OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
10 minutos 16 segundos10:16
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 16 segundos
So let me just I'm gonna share my screen. I'll just walk or I'm not sharing. I'm gonna walk through this with you.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
10 minutos 18 segundos10:18
Mateo Roldan Taborda 10 minutos 18 segundos
Yes.
BT
Brett Tatum
10 minutos 23 segundos10:23
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 23 segundos
So red team have deconstruction.
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 34 segundos
So in this case we would.
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 38 segundos
Be wanting to pull a report.
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 42 segundos
You're the only one in here.
Brett Tatum 10 minutos 53 segundos
They, I guess, don't use. Hold on, let me see here what I'm what am I missing?
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 2 segundos
I might be in the wrong spot. Hold on a second.
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 10 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 12 segundos
So for instance, like this is the list of users.
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 18 segundos
Or guys in the system. What what I'm really getting at here is like there's a way to.
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 27 segundos
Generate that.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
11 minutos 28 segundos11:28
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
11 minutos 31 segundos11:31
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 31 segundos
And then I guess I can only print this one. I can't.
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 40 segundos
Doesn't that doesn't export to Excel, so this may not be the best place for the example.
Brett Tatum 11 minutos 52 segundos
But like in theory, OK, let's put it because one of the piece of information we're gonna want in the report is what project they're going to.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos 1 segundo12:01
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 1 segundo
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 1 segundo12:01
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 1 segundo
So I would prefer them not have to put in a like type of project into red team and type of project into their labor tracker, right? I would like them to be able to like it from a drop down or from a you know.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
12 minutos 16 segundos12:16
Mateo Roldan Taborda 12 minutos 16 segundos
OK.
BT
Brett Tatum
12 minutos 20 segundos12:20
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 20 segundos
Selection that directly pulls from red team. So in this case we do have view.
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 30 segundos
You know you can download.
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 33 segundos
An Excel copy of the project.
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 38 segundos
Overview and see this has got all their project names. I don't know how this this is filtering probably somehow, but it didn't.
Brett Tatum 12 minutos 46 segundos
Doesn't really matter. The can you run like an automated process that opens up red team, selects that report, downloads it, saves it in a certain location, then allows bolt to read that file.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 4 segundos13:04
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 4 segundos
Well, safest way to put it into words, I don't know yet, but I'll make my due diligence and investigate how to do it. I know that there is a tons of ways that we can automate jobs out there, especially lately with. I don't know if you've heard a tool called N8A.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 9 segundos13:09
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 9 segundos
Sure, that's fine.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 24 segundos13:24
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 24 segundos
Which most likely can do this kind of stuff. Let me investigate. I do have access to Red Team. I've opened it a few times. Whenever you have a chance, please give me admin rights to FD.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 29 segundos13:29
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 29 segundos
Oh.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 41 segundos13:41
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 41 segundos
That way I'll be able to investigate further and I can give you a definite answer on that. I'm not sure if this is going to be 100% doable possible if there's going to be security breaches with red team pages.
BT
Brett Tatum
13 minutos 45 segundos13:45
Brett Tatum 13 minutos 45 segundos
Yeah.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
13 minutos 59 segundos13:59
Mateo Roldan Taborda 13 minutos 59 segundos
But I'll give it a try and I can give you a more definite answer the more we move on into the development for this new module. Does that make sense?
BT
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 10 segundos14:10
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 10 segundos
Yeah, absolutely. I think you. Yeah, the project manager has full admin rights, so if you run into any issues, let me know. But you should be good.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 19 segundos14:19
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 19 segundos
OK, I'll give it a try honestly, because it doesn't seem too complicated to do, but pretty much what it will need to do is to figure out a way to access to red team, get to the right section, pull up the right information.
BT
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 34 segundos14:34
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 34 segundos
Yep.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 36 segundos14:36
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 36 segundos
Download it and then pass it through Bolt pretty much.
BT
Brett Tatum
14 minutos 41 segundos14:41
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 41 segundos
Yeah, 'cause my my the the the bigger picture thought would be is.
Brett Tatum 14 minutos 47 segundos
There's there's probably half a dozen reports that we would want to pull out of red team on a regular basis that would create a effectively a database of information that then could.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
14 minutos 54 segundos14:54
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 54 segundos
Mm-hmm.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 14 minutos 55 segundos
Mhm.
BT
Brett Tatum
15 minutos 2 segundos15:02
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 2 segundos
Power bolt or or feed information to bolt. So like the idea would be is that like on a daily process or a multi times a day process the the macro or kind of like the bot that would be built would go into red team.
Mateo Roldan Taborda
15 minutos 5 segundos15:05
Mateo Roldan Taborda 15 minutos 5 segundos
So bold.
BT
Brett Tatum
15 minutos 18 segundos15:18
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 18 segundos
Grab all these reports, save them in a location.
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 23 segundos
And so you know you knew at 8:00 AM and at 5:00 PM all the information was gonna be updated or at 8:00 AM and noon or something like that. I don't know what the the right cadence would be. So if someone goes in and puts a new project into to red team.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
15 minutos 38 segundos15:38
Mateo Roldan Taborda 15 minutos 38 segundos
And then it automatically updates kind of like what Azure does with rocore.
BT
Brett Tatum
15 minutos 38 segundos15:38
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 38 segundos
Yeah.
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 40 segundos
Yes.
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 43 segundos
Yes.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
15 minutos 45 segundos15:45
Mateo Roldan Taborda 15 minutos 45 segundos
I look into it because I mean the main difference between Procore and this one is that Procore does offer an open API, right? So they make everything much more easier.
BT
Brett Tatum
15 minutos 46 segundos15:46
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 46 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 53 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 15 minutos 56 segundos
Yes.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
15 minutos 58 segundos15:58
Mateo Roldan Taborda 15 minutos 58 segundos
Red team, I need to look into alternatives in how to do that. So let's put the pin on that. I cannot make any promises on that yet because that will be shooting myself in the foot in terms of like what can I do on development in terms.
BT
Brett Tatum
16 minutos 12 segundos16:12
Brett Tatum 16 minutos 12 segundos
Sure.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
16 minutos 17 segundos16:17
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 17 segundos
For that, but I'll look into it is.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 21 segundos
I'll look into how feasible development on that will be on the future as well.
BT
Brett Tatum
16 minutos 25 segundos16:25
Brett Tatum 16 minutos 25 segundos
OK.
Brett Tatum 16 minutos 27 segundos
So I think first, first thing, let's just try to get this the the the form built and I yeah, like we don't because all of that is just gonna be additional like making it hopefully simple or simpler or more tied to red team. They'll be fine today just.
MT
Mateo Roldan Taborda
16 minutos 28 segundos16:28
Mateo Roldan Taborda 16 minutos 28 segundos

Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. It will be better for me to be able to like get it directly from them, how they want things, how, how they would like to see the new module for them. I'll start building and let's use the same schedule format that we've been using so far, 2 experience.

So I can have plenty of time to develop the new module if this is going to be. I always give it two weeks, but it's probably going to be less because this is fairly simple to do. And if we finish earlier, we can again shift our focus into something else. But let's keep it that way. Two weeks usually works for.

It's already it's already integrated so you are already paying for everything on the with Firebase because Firebase is all in one app like system that allows you to do pretty much everything. So all of the.

Functions that run in the in the cloud. Um.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 18 minutos 5 segundos
They will start stacking up eventually, but at the moment, like the costs, the costs for operating everything that we do on bolt, it's probably like a dollar or two a month. So it's not gonna get, yeah, it's for like text messages is not gonna be much.

It's probably going to run you like a dollar or two extra a month. It's not something that we're running thousands of messages a day or thousands of users at a time. So no worries, it's not gonna, it's not gonna skyrocket anytime soon. And if there is.

Brett Tatum 18 minutos 41 segundos
Cool. OK, well, I'll set up. I'm gonna call Harrison just as soon as we hang up to see what his schedule looks like today, but I'll try to get it something on schedule for this morning. So that way you've got that information to run with.

Yeah.
Mateo Roldan Taborda 18 minutos 53 segundos
Yeah, absolutely. I'll start working on that right away. Just a heads up as well. You are going to be seeing the module because you have admin access right away, but nobody else. This is going to be only for admins and FD people.

Mateo Roldan Taborda 19 minutos 11 segundos
Yeah, exactly. So you'll you'll be able to see it like on your regular view, but just rest assured nobody else is going to be able to see it unless they have admin or FD access, which at the moment it's just very few people.
